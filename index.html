<p>I have read both for over 20 years, but I&rsquo;m always surprised when I see one of Jon&rsquo;s articles on HN. They have always felt like different crowds to me. HN has always felt more about what&rsquo;s new with startups and tech, whereas Jon&rsquo;s articles range from excellent Apple insights to being an extension of Apple&rsquo;s PR department, which is fine. Jon has always been an Apple fan, but at some point, this take felt more fanboi than fanboy.</p>
<p>I suspect most of HN are big tech workers in a tech hub, startup bros/bras, and, on average, aren&rsquo;t daily Apple product users compared to what is mainstream.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Jon&rsquo;s writing has slipped, but he&rsquo;s pitching against a home team, which never sits well with the locals. ‚öæ</p>

			 <p>Late last year, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/jefftriplett/django-cli-no-admin"><code>django-cli-no-admin,</code></a> a proof-of-concept Python library whose goal was to shorten Django&rsquo;s default <code>django-admin</code> command to just <code>django</code>.</p>
<p>I published the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-cli-no-admin/">package on pypi</a> and it helped create one of the more colorful <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/name-the-main-command-django/37230">forum topics</a> of 2024. I ended up writing two blog posts about it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/12/14/new-project-to-shorten-djangoadmin/">New project to shorten django-admin to django because we are not monsters</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2025/01/08/rethinking-djangos-commandline-tool-why/">ü§î Rethinking Django&rsquo;s Command-Line Tool: Why We Should Rename <code>django-admin</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ever since I had this idea, the idea of building a better <code>django</code> command has stuck with me. While I don&rsquo;t see Django embracing the idea, of shortening its default command any time soon, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Lately, I have been doing a lot of vibe coding, and I took some inspiration from the <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code">claude-code</a>&rsquo;s cli app, which has a nice developer experience (DX). The claude-code app is version-aware and can query npm&rsquo;s servers to see if a newer version is out and can even update itself.</p>
<p>I took the output of a few of claude-code&rsquo;s commands and fed that back into Claude and I asked it to build a <code>django</code> command that can mimic this behavior with Django using either pip or UV and the PyPI servers to query for the latest Django version.</p>
<p>Here is what the output of my 2-minute vibe coding sessions resulted in or what I prefer to call Prompt-driven-development (PDD):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ django --version
5.1.6


$ django update
Current version: 5.1.6
Checking for updates...
New version available: 5.1.7 (current: 5.1.6)
Installing update...
Successfully updated from 0.5.1.6 to version 0.5.1.7
</code></pre><p>This just worked on the first try. I used a few follow-up prompts to make it less generic and to default to only ever checking Django.</p>
<p>One of my favorite features of prompt-driven development is that I create output like this and give it to Claude or ChatGPT, along with a few libraries with which I want to build a new tool. It gives me the working code back in seconds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly powerful to focus on the end result without worrying about a clever solution and getting lost along the way. With vibe coding or prompt-driven development, we skip the journey and focus on a better result at our destination.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-funding">What about funding?</h2>
<p>I noticed while updating another npm-based project today that it told me that two projects could be funded.</p>
<p>The Python Packaging User Guide lists <code>sponsor</code> in their <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/well-known-project-urls/#well-known-labels">Well-known labels</a> which gives us a data point we could use to list all of the projects that may be funded that we have installed within our Django and/or Python application.</p>
<p>We could also be baked into our <code>django</code> command to determine fundable projects.</p>
<h2 id="thinking-outside-the-box">Thinking outside the box</h2>
<p>Simon Willison&rsquo;s LLM command also ships with the ability to update itself and even install <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/setup.html#installing-plugins">its own plugins</a> by wrapping PIP or UV or whatever magic Simon thought up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate using a DX like <code>django install {package}</code> to install a new package into my application. It would be really cool if we could even add the package into <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> and make some other suggestion changes if the package could be installed in our urls.py or even explore optional settings that the package might support. I suspect this could even be locally LLM-driven if we wanted to test our docs.</p>
<p>I also recommend you check out Brett Cannon&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/brettcannon/python-launcher">python-launcher</a> app, a Python library wrapper. Brett was writing Rust wrappers to improve Python tooling before it was popular.</p>

			 <p>Lately, I have been conversing more with friends, colleagues, clients, and online friends about Claude and coding tools.</p>
<p>It turns out that everyone considers Claude to be something different when they ask, &ldquo;Have you tried out Claude 3.7 Sonnet?&rdquo; and that could mean through the website or the mobile app or people who are using it to write code or who are developing against one of Claude&rsquo;s many REST APIs. Some people primarily interact with Claude by speaking in their voices while walking outside with their pets.</p>
<p>I have even struggled to land at a good starting point, so I have been thinking through the various ways to explain how one might use Claude.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can access Claude Chat through the website.</li>
<li>You can access Claude through the mobile app and use voice support.</li>
<li>You can copy one or more files into Claude.</li>
<li>You can access Claude through an IDE.</li>
<li>You use Claude Projects to organize your projects and might even have a support document you give Claude for more context.</li>
<li>You can access Claude through the Claude Desktop app and use voice support.</li>
<li>You have enabled MCP plugins/servers within the Claude Desktop app.</li>
<li>You can access the Claude Code CLI/terminal app.</li>
<li>You have enabled MCP with the Claude Code CLI/terminal app.</li>
<li>You are writing your own MCP servers in Python or JavaScript.</li>
<li>You have registered for Claude API access and are writing code against one of their REST APIs. (more on this later)</li>
</ul>
<p>I originally broke this down into five levels of Claude, but there were too many platforms and features that blurred together.</p>
<h2 id="accessing-claude">Accessing Claude</h2>
<p>Accessing Claude can be confusing because there are many ways to access it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Web interface</li>
<li>Mobile app</li>
<li>Desktop app</li>
<li>CLI/Terminal app</li>
<li>REST API (could be a third-party app too, that requires a developer token)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="organization-by-experience-level">Organization by experience level</h2>
<p>If we break these down by user experience or technical proficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beginner</strong>: Web interface, mobile app, IDE integrations</li>
<li><strong>Intermediate</strong>: Desktop app, file uploads, REST API integration</li>
<li><strong>Advanced</strong>: Claude Code CLI</li>
<li><strong>Really Advanced</strong>: You are writing custom MCP implementations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="claudes-developer-apis">Claude&rsquo;s developer APIs</h2>
<p>Claude&rsquo;s Developer APIs have their vibes and are helpful in various situations. I&rsquo;m not going to deep dive into them, but from a bird&rsquo;s eye view:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text Completion API</li>
<li>Embeddings API</li>
<li>Messages API</li>
<li>Claude-in-the-Middle (Tools API and Agents)</li>
<li>Batch API</li>
</ul>
<p>These APIs can also vary based on passing them text, documents, images, or other types of files.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still amazed that I can send an image to Claude and ask it to give me back an HTML file and CSS, and it does a relatively decent job.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-claude-as-a-spectrum">Conclusion: Claude as a Spectrum</h2>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to end my notes, but I asked Claude to: &ldquo;Please write a conclusion about Claude being more of a spectrum than just a service.&rdquo; and this is what it told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When discussing &ldquo;Claude,&rdquo; we&rsquo;re not just talking about a single AI service but rather a spectrum of capabilities, interfaces, and integration points that serve different user needs, technical abilities, and use cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What makes this spectrum particularly interesting is how it creates different experiences and understanding of what &ldquo;Claude&rdquo; actually is. For a casual user accessing the web interface, Claude is simply a helpful chat assistant. For a developer using the API or building MCP servers, Claude becomes an extensible AI platform with programmable capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This spectrum explains why conversations about Claude can sometimes feel like people are talking about entirely different products. In a very real sense, they are. The Claude that helps a writer craft a story through the mobile app exists in a different context than the Claude that helps a developer debug code through an IDE integration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As the Claude ecosystem continues to evolve, this spectrum will likely expand further, with new interfaces, capabilities, and integration points creating even more varied experiences. Understanding Claude as a spectrum rather than a singular service helps contextualize these different experiences and provides a framework for navigating the growing complexity of AI assistants.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The most powerful aspect of this spectrum may be that it allows Claude to meet users where they are - from the casual web user to the advanced developer building custom AI solutions. This flexibility transforms Claude from merely an AI service into an adaptable AI ecosystem that can evolve alongside user needs and technical capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not half bad.</p>

			 <p>Lately, I have been trying to wrap my brain around AI Agents, so as a starting point, I have been using <a href="https://ai.pydantic.dev/agents/">Pydantic AI&rsquo;s Agent</a> class/framework to build &ldquo;Agents&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agent&rdquo; is a loaded term. Pydantic AI&rsquo;s usage is more or less a system prompt and a good API around adding tool calls and working with existing LLMs.</p>
<p>I have written several experimental projects to help me quickly research and find answers to several areas of Django that confuse people, including myself. These ask-one-question bots do their best to fetch the resources they need to answer your questions.</p>
<p>The three I have published publicly are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jefftriplett/django-trademark-agent">Django Trademark Agent</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jefftriplett/django-bylaws-agent">Django Bylaws Agent</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jefftriplett/django-dep-10-12-agent">Django DEP-10 and DEP-12 Agent</a></li>
</ul>
<p>None of these are official resources of the Django Software Foundation, nor should they be considered &ldquo;official&rdquo; or even &ldquo;legal&rdquo; answers to any questions that may arise.</p>
<p>The pattern I landed on for building the system prompts and pulling remote data has been a practical, quick way for me to get feedback and ask questions based on our existing material. I can change a local copy of the bylaws and then ask the Agent questions to see if my potential changes might be comprehensive enough for the Agent to answer.</p>
<p>It effectively feels like running tests on governance to see if the Agent picks up on my changes.</p>
<h2 id="our-cheat-codes">Our Cheat Codes</h2>
<p>These are cheat codes for a quick one-file Agent that one can quickly stand up and ask questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>UV is a cheat code because it can quickly create a one-file Agent with dependencies and the version of Python needed to run the demo baked in.</li>
<li>Pydantic AI&rsquo;s Agent class is a nice wrapper around a system prompt and can even create a dynamic system prompt. Having a global system prompt has a nice feel to it too.</li>
<li>Pydantic&rsquo;s <code>BaseModel</code> creates structured data responses as a cheat code for processing unstructured text. If you haven&rsquo;t seen this pattern yet, you can&rsquo;t unsee it.</li>
<li>The Jina AI for cleaning up HTML into Markdown is an AI I have wanted for a decade+. I use it in dozens of apps for free, saving me hours of work.</li>
<li>The Python libraries Typer, Rich, and httpx may not seem like they are doing much, and I&rsquo;m underutilizing them, but their Developer Experience (DX) is great, and they just work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="more-areas-to-explore">More areas to explore</h2>
<p>Pydantic AI supports dynamic <a href="https://ai.pydantic.dev/agents/#system-prompts">System Prompts</a>, which might save me a few extra templating steps. They didn&rsquo;t really click for me before I was writing this post.</p>
<p>When I wrote my Django Agents, I had Pydantic AI&rsquo;s <a href="https://ai.pydantic.dev/multi-agent-applications/">Multi-agent Applications</a> feature in mind. In theory, I want to ask my Django Agents a question and have it route my question to the appropriate Agent to get an answer.</p>
<p><a href="https://ai.pydantic.dev/tools/">Function Tools</a> or Tool Call is what inspired me to try out Pydantic AI. Function Tools are a way to give LLMs the ability to get information outside of their memory and system prompts when needed. I built one for reading and writing to my work calendar to help me manage my schedule. I didn&rsquo;t use them for my suite of Django Agents, but when mixed with more real-time data they could be helpful.</p>
<p>We could also refactor each Agent using a reusable tool call so we could assemble one Agent that can gather the information needed to answer common Django Governance questions. I don&rsquo;t know if that would be effective. In theory, it might not be a bad fit after looking at their <a href="https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/common_tools/duckduckgo.py">DuckDuckGoSearchTool</a> example.</p>

			 <p>I have been hosting a weekly(ish) office for a few years now. Most Fridays start around 2:30 PM Central because that works well for me. These started as an excuse for me to work on open source and side projects and became a banter for many remote people.</p>
<p>I also plan to host a monthly morning edition so friends in other time zones can join.</p>
<p>Since I started hosting weekly(ish) office hours, other groups, including the DSF, Wagtail, and various PSF factions, have begun hosting their own. I try to join a few of those when I can.</p>
<h2 id="jeffs-office-hours-these-are-mine">Jeff&rsquo;s Office Hours (these are mine)</h2>
<p>I host my weekly office hours on most Fridays starting around 2:30 PM Central. Once a month, I plan on hosting them at 8 AM or 9 AM Central.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the goal? I am usually done with client work for the week, and by Friday afternoon, I use it as an excuse to work on some of my projects and to banter. It&rsquo;s become an office water cooler for many people who want a place to chill to end their week.</p>
<p>How to join? They are always on Zoom. Contact <a href="https://mastodon.social/@webology">me</a> for a meeting gist/invite.</p>
<h2 id="wagtail-office-hours">Wagtail Office Hours</h2>
<p><a href="https://fosstodon.org/@vossisboss">Meagen Voss</a> hosts weekly Wagtail Office Hours on Wednesdays from 3:30 PM - 5:30 PM Eastern Time (US and Canada).</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the goal? To work on Wagtail or Wagtail projects together with other community members.</p>
<p>How to join? They are always on Google Meet. Reach out to Meagen for a meeting gist/invite.</p>
<h2 id="dsf-office-hours">DSF Office Hours</h2>
<p><a href="https://social.jacobian.org/@jacob">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a> or at least one board member from the DSF hosts these weekly on Wednesdays at 1 PM Eastern Time (US and Canada).</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the goal? To work on anything related to the DSF. It&rsquo;s also a good space to ask questions.</p>
<p>How to join? They are always on Google Meet. Contact Jacob or another DSF member for a meeting gist/invite.</p>
<h2 id="conference-chats-twice-a-month-meetups">Conference Chats twice a month meetups</h2>
<p>While these aren&rsquo;t officially &ldquo;Office Hours,&rdquo; I have been a member since day one.</p>
<p>If you run a conference or event and you are looking for a like-minded group to learn and share with, they host two meetups every month:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first Friday of the month starting at 1:00 PM US Eastern time</li>
<li>The second Wednesday of the month starting at 9:00 PM US Eastern time</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out their website for the most recent schedule: <a href="https://www.conferencechats.org">www.conferencechats.org</a></p>
<p>My office hours are a byproduct of hanging out with the Conference Chats and wanting an excuse to talk off-topic.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Office hours have become more than just a way to squeeze in extra project time‚Äîthey&rsquo;ve become their own communities and spaces. Whether you join for some off-topic banter or to dive deep into a project, there&rsquo;s always a space for you. Feel free to reach out, join a session, or even start your own office hours if you think your community could use another one.</p>

			 <p>I have been using, working, and running commercial and local LLMs for years, but I never got around to sharing the tools and applications I use. Here are some quick notes, tools, and resources I have landed on and use daily.</p>
<h2 id="mac-apps-i-use">Mac Apps I use:</h2>
<p>I do all of my development on Macs. These tools make running local LLMs accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://ollama.com">Ollama</a> is the server that can download and run 100s of AI models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kevinhermawan/Ollamac">Ollamac</a> is a GUI client for Ollama that lets you write prompts, save history, and allow you to pick models to test out quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://tailscale.com">Tailscale</a> I use Tailscale on all of my devices, which gives me access to my work M2 Mac Studio and home office Mac Mini Pro, which both run Ollama, from anywhere in the world. This makes prototyping at home quick but then I can run a larger model from my work machine and it&rsquo;s so fast, it feels like the machine is running in my house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/openai-bundle">OpenAI Bundle</a>‚ÄîI bought this bundle because it was the cheapest way to get a bunch of AI apps, including four of Jordi Bruin&rsquo;s apps. I have used these for a few years.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper">MacWhisper</a> - I use MacWhisper to turn voice notes and podcasts into plain text files for my notes and sometimes blog articles.</li>
<li><a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/voices">Voices</a> - I use Voices when I find a large blog post and want to listen to it while working.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://claude.ai/download">Claude for Desktop</a> gets a lot of crap for being &ldquo;yet another Electron app&rdquo; instead of a custom-built macOS app, but the people saying that don&rsquo;t know what they are talking about. The Claude Desktop has voice support and keyboard hotkeys, which make the app incredibly useful. More importantly, Claude Desktop also supports <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io">Model Context Protocol</a>, which lets Claude access your file system, git, and anything else you want to access. It&rsquo;s incredibly powerful, and there&rsquo;s nothing quite like it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="baseline-rules-for-running-a-model">Baseline rules for running a model</h2>
<p>While running models locally is possible, consumer hardware is constrained by RAM and GPU for even the most miniature models. The easiest mental model to work with is that Billions of parameters are roughly equivalent to your system&rsquo;s RAM in Gigabytes. An 8B model needs roughly 8G RAM to fit into memory.</p>
<p>My mental formula is somewhat lossy because 40B models fit 32G of memory, and 72B models fit 64G of memory with some room to spare. This is just the rough estimate that I use.</p>
<p>Even though you can run models locally, even the smallest models with a significant context window will exceed your machine&rsquo;s available RAM. A 128k context window needs about 64 GB of RAM to load into memory for an 8B parameter model fully, even though the model can easily fit into 8GB of RAM. That doesn&rsquo;t mean the model won&rsquo;t run locally, but it will run closer than it would if you have more than 72 GB of RAM, which your model fully needs to fit.</p>
<p>I look for three things when I&rsquo;m evaluating a model:</p>
<ul>
<li>A number of parameters are measured in Billions.</li>
<li>Context length
<ul>
<li>The input context length, which effectively the model&rsquo;s memory</li>
<li>The output context length, which is how big the answer can be</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The type of model:
<ul>
<li><strong>Default Models</strong>  are general-purpose models like GPT-4 and Llama 3.3.</li>
<li><strong>Vision Models</strong> and process and read visual data like images and videos.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Models</strong> can call external tools and APIs and perform custom actions to which you give them access.</li>
<li><strong>Embedding Models</strong> can turn text into vectors or tokens, which helps measure your prompts and other RAG operations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What about quantization? Quantization can help you scale a model down so that it might fit into memory, but there&rsquo;s always a loss in quality, which defeats the purpose of using the bigger model in my book.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-up">Keeping up</h2>
<p>My favorite resource for keeping up is <a href="https://ollama.com/search?o=newest">Ollama&rsquo;s Models page sorted by Newest</a> models. I check it a few times a day and you&rsquo;ll see new models release single-digit hours to days before press releases can catch up.</p>
<p>I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@technovangelist">Matt Williams'</a> YouTube Channel a lot. It&rsquo;s the one channel I come back to, and I find that I always learn something from it. His videos tend to be ten to twenty minutes long, which is about right since the material is so dense.</p>
<p>Start with his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfFRNF5AhME">Optimize Your AI Models</a> videos. They&rsquo;re a lot to fit in your brain, but they&rsquo;re a great starting point.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have to write a few posts on how I&rsquo;m using LLMs with code, but Simon&rsquo;s <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/">LLM</a> is a good general-purpose AI hammer if you need one.</p>
<p>As of last week, I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://ai.pydantic.dev">Pydantic AI</a> instead of OpenAI&rsquo;s or Anthropic&rsquo;s Python libraries. Pydantic AI will install both of those libraries for you, but I find it to be 100% better and easier to switch between models using it than LangChain (not linked) or anything else I have tried.</p>

			 <p>One of the most significant Python innovations in my development toolchain was the <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com">Click</a> utility, which simplified the creation of Python scripts. Click changed how I approach writing one-off Python scripts and made it easier for me to write better developer experiences around those scripts.</p>
<p>Once I found <a href="https://github.com/GaretJax/django-click">django-click</a>, writing Django management commands was a breeze, using the same Click API that I was already familiar with.</p>
<p>Arguably, the second most significant innovation was the <a href="https://typer.tiangolo.com">Typer</a> library, built on Click, making writing Python scripts even easier. I didn&rsquo;t think it was possible to be easier than Python Click until Typer came out and proved me wrong.</p>
<h2 id="the-python-click-library">The Python Click library</h2>
<p>A typical pattern I use with Click is creating a command that accepts an argument like a URL.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> click

<span style="color:#a6e22e">@click</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>argument(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;url&#34;</span>, type<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>str)
<span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">command</span>(url):
	do_something(url<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>url)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="the-python-django-click-library">The Python django-click library</h2>
<p>This works well, but one improvement would be to accept as many <code>url</code> arguments as I can pass to it. Thankfully, Click solves this with the <code>nargs</code> argument. I always have to look this up, which is why we are here.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> djclick <span style="color:#66d9ef">as</span> click

        do_something(url<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>url)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="the-python-typer-library">The Python Typer library</h2>
<p>Suppose we were writing this example with Typer. In that case, we could simplify it to using Python&rsquo;s native data types, which would make it feel more like I&rsquo;m writing native code and less like I&rsquo;m using a library.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> typer

</code></pre></div><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/django-commons/django-typer">django-typer</a> library, bringing the Typer library to Django. I suspect I&rsquo;ll switch to django-typer the next time I start a new project to give it a good test drive. I can speculate on what that looks like, but I&rsquo;ll leave that for another day.</p>

			 <p>I was feeling overloaded with emails this week, and then I remembered that my out-of-office auto-responder told people they should contact me after the first of the year if they needed me to reply.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I could select and archive all of my 2024 emails with this rule <code>label:inbox after:2023/12/31 before:2025/01/01</code>, which reconciled my old emails.</p>
<h2 id="calendars-and-shared-documents">Calendars and shared Documents</h2>
<p>With each Google organization, I&rsquo;m a member with another Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Google Contacts to manage. That document someone wants feedback on sometimes feels like spinning a wheel, and I need to guess which inbox and account the message might land in.</p>
<p>The best solution that I have found for juggling meeting invites is <a href="https://reclaim.ai">Reclaim</a>, which is terrific for merging multiple calendars into one calendar so I can at least keep on top of meeting invites and scheduling. Dropbox recently bought them, but I&rsquo;m hoping that Dropbox will leave them alone.</p>
<p>Email and calendars have become more challenging since I switched to a Mac Studio at the office. While we were returning to work during a blizzard last week, I realized that my personal Mac Mini in my home office had no concept of my work calendar or the 4 or 7 Vivaldi profiles with syncing that I use to jump between orgs all day.</p>
<p>With 1Password, this is a straightforward process to set up and authorize, but it still takes time.</p>
<p>Tonight, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I even locked myself out of one service because it&rsquo;s probably not a typical usage pattern to jump between three Macs over two locations with a half dozen profiles to juggle.</p>
<h2 id="calendar-agent">Calendar Agent</h2>
<p>Over the Thanksgiving break, I wrote my first Calendar Agent, who can read and write to my work calendar. It&rsquo;s not fully baked yet, but it works well enough to tell me about my upcoming meetings and to create a meeting for me. Sometimes.</p>
<p>The biggest downside to using my Calendar Agent is that I have to run it from my terminal, which isn&rsquo;t always the most convenient place.</p>
<p>Side note: I might rewrite my agent using <a href="https://ai.pydantic.dev">PydanticAI</a> as an excuse to learn about the Python agent framework, streamline tool-calling, and play with more local agents using <a href="https://ollama.com">Ollama</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-better-email-solution">The better email solution</h2>
<p>The better email solution was a Django email app called Concorde, one of <a href="https://github.com/adamfast">Adam Fast</a>&rsquo;s creations. It was Django querysets for managing email rules, which I modified and ran over the years. It quickly created better rules than Gmail supported, like deleting old messages in specific folders after x-days. When I kept my fork running and updated, the tool was invaluable. When I kept my Concorde up and running, my email life was healthier than when I was slower to fix it after an upgrade.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m annoyed that the best solutions for these problems are to either pay a company to make a Google Suite usable or you must be a developer to build tools to manage it all.</p>
<p>This stuff sucks.</p>

<p>I paired DTEM with <a href="https://github.com/django-q2/django-q2">Django-Q2</a>, my favorite Django task queue. It can work with just the Django ORM, which is good enough for projects like Django News Jobs, which are relatively low traffic but spiky traffic.</p>
<p>If my email-sending provider times out or I have an issue, like my credit card expiring, I never want a user to see it. So, I use a task queue to handle all potentially blocking processes, like sending emails.</p>
<p>Django-Q2 is painless to configure. Using it involves importing <code>async_task</code> and modifying our <code>send_templated_mail</code> method to be an argument to the <code>async_task</code> method.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Django has been a key tool for Python web developers for many years. But as new frameworks like FastAPI become prevalent, it&rsquo;s important to ensure Django stays easy for new and experienced developers. Recently, a <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/name-the-main-command-django/37230">discussion thread</a> received over 60 comments about changing Django&rsquo;s main command from <code>django-admin</code> to something else, like <code>django</code>. The thread also explored other <code>django-cmd</code> possibilities, showcasing many ideas. While the conversation was broad, I want to focus on why renaming <code>django-admin</code> is a good idea.</p>
<h2 id="why-rename-django-admin">Why Rename <code>django-admin</code>?</h2>
<h3 id="keep-it-simple-and-pythonic">Keep It Simple and Pythonic</h3>
<p>When I chaired DjangoCon US, a common question I asked attendees during our opening session was whether they learned Django first or Python first. It surprised me to see the majority of hands raised for &ldquo;Django first,&rdquo; which meant that learning Django taught them Python. This showed me how important Django is for teaching Python.</p>
<p>Because Django helps so many people learn Python, it should follow Python&rsquo;s simple and clean style. Changing <code>django-admin</code> to <code>django</code> makes the command easier to remember and use. New developers won&rsquo;t have to remember an extra non-off command, making their experience smoother.</p>
<h3 id="easy-transition-for-everyone">Easy Transition for Everyone</h3>
<p>One great thing about <code>django-admin</code> is that it has been the same for many years. If we rename it to <code>django</code>, we don&rsquo;t have to remove <code>django-admin</code>. Instead, we can make <code>django</code> an alias for <code>django-admin</code>. This way, old projects can keep using <code>django-admin</code>, and new projects can use <code>django</code>. This change won&rsquo;t disrupt anyone&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 id="real-life-benefits">Real-Life Benefits</h2>
<p>This change is prompted by common problems in the Django community. For example, a <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/running-django-admin-as-a-python-module/36401">forum post</a> showed that some developers get confused when trying to run <code>django-admin</code> as a Python module. They saw errors like <code>ModuleNotFound</code> because it wasn&rsquo;t obvious why <code>python -m django-admin</code> didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<h3 id="improving-compatibility-with-tools-like-uv">Improving Compatibility with Tools Like UV</h3>
<p>Another issue is that commands like <code>uv tool run django</code> don&rsquo;t work as expected, but they could. Python&rsquo;s best practices support using <code>python -m django</code>, which would work smoothly with tools like UV if Django updated its command structure. Instead, the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; answer is to run <code>uv tool run --from django django-admin</code> to bootstrap a Django project.</p>
<p>Renaming <code>django-admin</code> to <code>django</code> and aligning with Python&rsquo;s module execution standards can make integrating Django with such tools just work. This change would help developers avoid errors and follow best practices, enhancing overall compatibility and workflow.</p>
<p>As it exists today, a new user has to learn to use <code>django-admin</code> to start a project, and then later, once they learn from seeing <code>python -m pip</code> used.</p>
<h2 id="balancing-old-and-new">Balancing Old and New</h2>
<p>Django has been around for a long time and has a strong history. It&rsquo;s important to keep what makes Django great while also making improvements. Renaming <code>django-admin</code> to <code>django</code> respects Django&rsquo;s past and helps it move forward. This change keeps Django reliable for long-time users while improving it for new developers.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-change-zero-work">Is this change zero work?</h2>
<p>No, it requires a <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/12/14/new-project-to-shorten-djangoadmin/">one-line config change</a> and replacing every instance of <code>django-admin</code> in the docs. Any changes in Django&rsquo;s docs will inevitably trigger translation changes, but these should be small and tightly scoped. As of today, there are <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/search/?q=%22django-admin%22">39-page instances</a> to update.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Renaming <code>django-admin</code> to <code>django</code> improves Django&rsquo;s developer experience. This new name makes the command more straightforward to remember and follows Python&rsquo;s best practices. It also makes it simpler for new developers to start with modern tools like UV.</p>
<p>Although this change means updating some configuration files and documentation, the long-term benefits of having a clearer and more Python-like command are much greater than the initial work needed. Keeping <code>django-admin</code> as an alias also ensures that existing projects continue to work without problems.</p>

			 <p>I love end-of-year posts and reading everyone&rsquo;s posts. Every year, I draft one, and then I give up on publishing it around March or April after a comically long time. I&rsquo;m going for shorter than longer this year because a lot happened this year, but most important is how I felt closing 2024 out. Overall, 2024 was a good year despite its many ups and downs.</p>
<h2 id="family">Family</h2>
<p>My kids grew a ton; we ended the year with a three and seven-year-old. Three-year-olds have big personalities, and my first-grader decided he could read anything after the first two weeks of school. We had several family trips, including a big family reunion in Chicago(ish) and a trip with my family to Colorado, so we got to see a lot of both families.</p>
<p>Each of our parents went through one hip surgery, and both are doing well. One of my parents had some more serious medical issues that we are hoping are behind everyone now. We buried two aunts in 2024, which brings me down to just one aunt and uncle (both by marriage).</p>
<p>Because time is so short, my new metric of a good year is measured by the health and well-being of our family and parents.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>I published <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/archive/">230 posts</a> this year on my <a href="https://micro.webology.dev">Micro Blog</a>, which ranged from short thoughts to longer posts. I have always wanted to blog, but 2024 is the year I finally made it a priority and figured out what worked for me to ease the publishing friction. I wrote about everything from Python to Django to UV to what I was watching, and I was surprised to see it inspire other blog posts and podcasts. So writing works, friends. Even if it&rsquo;s just about what show you watched last night.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also pleased with how my <a href="https://jefftriplett.com/now/">Now</a> turned out. The page shows the latest movies, series, and games we are playing. It&rsquo;s rapidly becoming a dashboard for me, which might be what my homepage turns into.</p>
<h2 id="conferences">Conferences</h2>
<p>I attended PyCon US in person for the first time since 2019 and DjangoCon US.</p>
<h2 id="volunteercommunity-work">Volunteer/Community Work</h2>
<p>2024 was a break for me after a decade of leadership roles in several non-profits. After five years on the Python Software Foundation board, 2024 was my first full year off. I stayed in one workgroup, but I stepped down on everything else.</p>
<p>After serving as President or Vice President, 2024 was my first full year as <strong>only</strong> a Django Events Foundation of North America (DEFNA) director and a DjangoCon US organizer. I had room to volunteer during DjangoCon US without my time being spoken for. It felt more or less like an emeritus role.</p>
<p>I mentored a small cohort for Djangonaut Space this year for the <a href="https://djangopackages.org">Django Packages</a> project. It was a rewarding process, and I look forward to helping in a future session now that I know what to do. (If you were in my cohort, I promise to post that follow-up blog post soon.)</p>
<p>I joined the Django Software Foundation (DSF) in December, intending to hire an Executive Director. I was so happy to have my time back in 2024 that I decided to give the DSF one more year to do this on their own, but a small mob of friends asked me to run at DjangoCon US this year. So, I ran for the board, and now I have less than two years to hire someone so I can go back to normal life.</p>
<h2 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h2>
<p>I hosted several Office Hours every month, letting them grow into what they needed to be. Some weeks were more structured than others, but watching this turn into a community on its own with lots of new and regular faces joining and sticking around. It&rsquo;s fun and something I want to keep doing in 2025.</p>
<h2 id="side-quests">Side Quests</h2>
<p>I enjoyed a ton of side quests this year, which I have already written about over the last year. From the newsletter to a job board to even a project to try to make Django talks more discoverable to a bunch of random AI projects. I had a lot of fun working on side projects and side quests.</p>
<h2 id="going-forward">Going forward</h2>
<p>I left a ton of details out, but that&rsquo;s alright. After 230 posts last year, it&rsquo;s hard to summarize the journey, but I plan to keep removing the friction that keeps my drafts above 200 posts, which may never see the light of day.</p>

			 <p>I mostly finished my holiday shopping this week. I picked up a few gifts for my family throughout the year and then randomly stressed out last week, thinking I didn&rsquo;t have enough. I picked up a few last-minute items, and everyone was in good shape outside of a few gift cards. Now, to wrap everything&hellip;</p>

<p>Lately, my weekly notes have been more like monthly notes. I draft them, forget to finish/publish them, and then the following Sunday morning, I start another week. So here we are again.</p>

<p>December is LEGO advent calendar month in my household. Our recently turned three-year-old participates for the first time with the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/advent-calendar-2024-43253">LEGO¬Æ «Ä Disney Advent Calendar 2024</a>, and our seven-year-old picked the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-star-wars-advent-calendar-2024-75395">LEGO¬Æ Star Wars‚Ñ¢ Advent Calendar 2024</a>. Even if you are a grownup, these are fun, and you get some cool LEGO mini-figures.</p>
<h2 id="house">House</h2>
<p>If you ask our three-year-old what she wants for Christmas, she defaults to &ldquo;Rainbow lights&rdquo; because I didn&rsquo;t put any lights up outside. Between our Thanksgiving trip to Chicago and two weeks of everyone in the house cycling through the crud, here we are, but at least the Christmas tree got put up.</p>
<h2 id="community-work">Community Work</h2>
<p>My community cups ran over a bit this week. This is due to my being new to the DSF Board and various end-of-year and before-holidays &ldquo;things&rdquo; that pop up.</p>
<p>Community work cut into some of my open-source projects, but I&rsquo;d like to catch up over the holidays.</p>
<p>I also ended my week with my last Office Hours of 2024. This week was a little too non-profit and community-heavy, so I will balance that better. With the DSF having its own office hours, I want to keep solving those problems in the proper space.</p>

<p>We picked up <a href="https://www.backloggd.com/games/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind/">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita&rsquo;s Rewind</a> and finished it last week. It was fun, and we like these retro games, but it&rsquo;s not TMNT&rsquo;s level of replayability. The game has three hours of gameplay. I&rsquo;m hoping future updates address this.</p>
<p>I read mixed reviews on <a href="https://www.backloggd.com/games/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra/">G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra</a>, but my son was pretty excited about the new Power Rangers game, so we picked it up as a beat &lsquo;em up game we could play over the weekend. It&rsquo;s buggy in ways that make me wonder how this game has been out for a few months and still has this level of bugs. The controls are bad, but we somehow played through to the last stage before we both shrugged and decided to call it a night. I would give it a two out of five stars type of game. If it weren&rsquo;t for the nostalgia from my youth, I&rsquo;d give it one or one and a half stars.</p>
<h2 id="new-gear">New gear</h2>
<p>My NanoKVMs arrived a few weeks ago. I quickly ran out of ports, so I ordered some short HDMI cables, Cat6 cables, more UBC-C cables, and a cheap 8-port switch.</p>
<p>I also lost my Home Assistant machine again, so I swapped out RPis and still ran into issues. As impressive as Home Assistant, running, maintaining, and keeping running is a pain. I have been debating switching to one of their yellow box hardware solutions to support them financially and hoping that I won&rsquo;t lose my box once a year because it&rsquo;s so hard to troubleshoot and fix.</p>
<p>I also picked up a 50-foot sewer cam (for looking in walls and vents), an under-desk walking treadmill, and a smart garage door opener to replace our smart Chamberlain garage door opener because they dropped their API.</p>

			 <p>December 21 is <a href="https://www.volunteeramnestyday.net">Volunteer Responsibility Amnesty Day</a>, one of two days every year that allows you to build out your responsibility inventory and decide what you have time for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Volunteer Responsibility Amnesty Day is about checking with yourself, and ending the commitments you need to end ‚Äì maybe by taking a break, or by rotating it on to someone else, or by sunsetting a project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the best ideas in tech because it creates space to de-commit from projects we might not otherwise have time for, but we feel like we&rsquo;d be letting people down by stepping back from. It&rsquo;s a wonderful excuse to step back from projects that have been weighing on your mind.</p>
<h2 id="what-im-stepping-down-from">What I&rsquo;m stepping down from</h2>
<p>This year, I decided it was time to step down from the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/paramiko">Paramiko</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fabric">Fabric</a>,  and <a href="https://github.com/pyinvoke">Invoke</a> Triage Teams because I had not been active there in years. I volunteered to help triage issues that were always a bit over my head.</p>
<p>I joined when <a href="https://github.com/bitprophet">Jeff Forcier</a> needed some extra hands, and it might have helped get another maintainer signed up who could help out more. At PyCon US this year, I got to hang out with Jeff. I gave him a heads-up that I felt like I was excess baggage to the project because my good intentions were no longer turning into helping out the project. I have much respect for Jeff (#teamjeff) and all three of these projects.</p>
<p>If you have free cycles and can help with these projects, please check out the open issues and see if you can help. I use all three beneficial projects in one way or another every week.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-can-do">What you can do</h2>
<p>Suppose you are signing up for projects but are not fulfilling your commitment. In that case, I encourage you to use Volunteer Responsibility Amnesty Day as motivation to step down from whatever project or responsibility you may have.</p>
<p>I also want to call out some members of the Python and Django communities. If you are signing up to help with projects you know you won&rsquo;t have time for, please step back and encourage someone else to help with those projects and roles. If you know that famous face you see plastered on every website and they are friends, please ask them if they know about Volunteer Responsibility Amnesty Day and share your list. That nudge may help them decide if they are taking on too much.</p>

<p>I spent most of 2024 Chrome-free, the new cage-free because I was so frustrated at Mozilla that I deleted Firefox from all my machines. I have doubled my Gmail Accounts and usage between non-profits and community projects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a happy <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> user and advocate. I only had a handful of issues, quickly solved by turning all or some level of trackers back on. The worst offenders were both my bank and my credit card company.</p>
<p>I dropped <a href="https://www.macbartender.com">Bartender</a> and switched to <a href="https://icemenubar.app">Ice</a> after the company started acting shady due to poor communication. I have no regrets.</p>
<p>My beloved Overcast podcasting app has been complete garbage for more of 2024 than it was working. The author rewrote it, and it became an unusable disaster for months, one part of Marco&rsquo;s fault and one part of Apple&rsquo;s fault for making the iOS App Store such a pain to release products into. It still has Airplay issues and crashes on me, but I can once again play more than one podcast in a row without it crashing. I tried many other podcast apps, and I&rsquo;m sad that this is the state of things.</p>
<p>I have mostly switched from Docker to OrbStack, which I highly recommend for my development life. I keep Docker around for Compose, but I have several legacy projects I haven&rsquo;t ported yet.</p>

			 <p>Last week, I wrote but didn&rsquo;t publish some notes about why the Django and Python communities use so many Google Forms.</p>
<p>The simple answer is that Google Forms are quick and easy to set up, and data can be easily exported via Google Sheets or a CSV file.</p>
<p>Getting data in and out of Django isn&rsquo;t hard, but why isn&rsquo;t it as easy as using Google Forms?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see a Django version of Google Forms that we can all use.</p>
<p>Has anyone solved this problem?</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, Django ships with a <code>JSONField</code>, which can store any form data we want without having to migrate databases. Turning a flat <code>JSONField</code> into CSV is already a solved problem.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> I am not looking for a Django forms wrapper or your opinions about why Django should use your fancy Django forms tool.</p>

			 <h2 id="family">Family</h2>
<p>We drove up to Chicago to see family for five days. It&rsquo;s a 7.25-hour drive if not stopping were an option, but we usually have to stop at least two or three times to re-fuel, eat, and have a few bathroom breaks. Both of my kids are pro-travelers. Give them an iPad with an offline cache of their favorite Disney and Netflix movies and series, plus some snacks, and they are good to go for 8 to 16 hours. On our last trip back from Omaha, they complained that it was too short because we didn&rsquo;t stop on our 2.5-hour drive back.</p>
<p>We take turns driving, and through the magic of tethering, I&rsquo;m surprised that I can comfortably use my laptop from the car for half the trip.</p>
<p>Seeing family was good. There are five kids, ranging from two to nine, but this year everyone is out of diapers, everyone can communicate their needs, and everyone plays together nicely.</p>
<p>We decided to avoid dinner prep drama for Thanksgiving and go out for Mexican food and margaritas. This was an excellent idea. The staff was super friendly, the food was excellent, the margaritas were the right amount of salty and sweet, and everyone got to pick something they enjoyed. There was no food prep or cleanup stress. Overall, our bill for 10 people plus a very generous tip, even after a service fee, was much less than it costs to try to feed 10 people a traditional spread.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>It was a short, two-day workweek for me. I helped a client with an inventory project running a week or two behind on their side. The timing wasn&rsquo;t great because it all landed on my lap the day before I was heading out of town, and it took a few days to run. I hate k8s even more than before.</p>
<p>My main client is missing a tool or two to nail the pulse. I have thought about this because everything takes less time to complete but more time to work on the problem, so things are stretched out. The holiday break was the mental reset I needed to know how to manage this for the next month until our winter break.</p>
<h2 id="community-work">Community Work</h2>
<p>I skipped all Office Hours this week, but it was a busier few days for my DSF CoC WG card. We reset/rebooted the WG a month ago and have more members and communication. It&rsquo;s taking more time to reset and settle into a healthy normal.</p>

<h3 id="calendar-agent">Calendar Agent</h3>
<p>I spent some free time over the break working on an app that lets ChatGPT control my work calendar. I got the basics up quickly, and my Calendar Agent (Bot?) can look at what&rsquo;s scheduled on my calendar and create new events for me. The hardest part was navigating Google permissions (I hate them) so that I could access my calendar through Python. Once I got that setup, I used Claude Projects to help me write most of the code.</p>
<p>I ran into an issue with tool calling because I wanted to let the Agent query the time for a day before creating the event. I shifted this logic into my create event function as a fix and realized I was way overthinking it. Now, I have an interesting agent. Still, I have yet to figure out how to run it outside my terminal, which isn&rsquo;t helpful.</p>
<h2 id="entertainment">Entertainment</h2>
<p>I mostly watched football and basketball this week, but I started a few shows from <a href="https://jefftriplett.com/now/">jefftriplett.com/now/</a></p>
<h2 id="new-gear">New gear</h2>
<p>Since it was Black Friday, I did some shopping, but not as much as in previous years. I noticed Mastodon vibes are anti-Black Friday, whereas Blue Sky and X are more about saving money and getting a deal. More of my friends shared deals over Slack and Discord than in previous years.</p>
<p>I picked up a five-pack of 32 GB microSD drives for my NanoKVMs, which I hope will be delivered next week. I also bought the family an Air Fryer convection oven combo unit, which may replace our old toaster and be helpful.</p>
<h2 id="next-week">Next week</h2>
<p>We get to start our LEGO Advent Calendars. I started this tradition with my son when he was two or three. My daughter will be three in a few weeks, so she is now old enough to join in the tradition, too. She requested the Disney Princess calendar, and my son has the Star Wars set. We skipped the traditional set because one can only have so many Santa Clauses.</p>

<h2 id="family">Family</h2>
<p>We have hosted family quite a bit over the last month. Our parents have also had two hip replacements (one last week and one three months ago) and a minor (it could have been much, much worse) wreck on their way to see us last weekend. Thankfully, everyone is safe and doing well.</p>
<p>My son is four games into recreation league basketball and had a breakout game this weekend. He was due for one and has been practicing a lot. He&rsquo;s fun to watch, and sometimes it just clicks that he can take the ball away from someone or dribble in and score. He is also the best passer on his team and can dribble well.</p>
<p>The rest of our family is doing well, but we have been unexpectedly car shopping.</p>

<p>My friend Adam let me borrow one of his spare <a href="https://github.com/sipeed/NanoKVM">NanoKVM</a> units, which has been a lot of fun. I tested it on my older Intel NUC and an iPad Mini, and both just worked, which surprised me. The device can run Tailscale, too, and serves as a remote hardware KVM that can boot or install a remote machine. I ordered a five-pack of NanoKVMs a few weeks ago because I had a few machines that needed to access that were stuck on boot or other &ldquo;press any key&rdquo; prompts before the machines would finish booting.</p>
<h2 id="entertainment">Entertainment</h2>
<p>I will defer to my <a href="https://jefftriplett.com/now/">Now page</a>, which tracks the series, movies, and games I&rsquo;m watching or playing with my kids. It&rsquo;s primarily data-driven and automated, and I&rsquo;m happy with it. I plan to add gear and other data types as I go.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24291281/mobvoi-home-walking-pad-review-treadmills-fitness">I got a desk treadmill to relieve stress‚Äîinstead, it stressed me out</a>. I picked up one of these desk treadmills for work, but I haven&rsquo;t gotten a chance to try it out yet. I found an extra-long power cord for it, which will work with my standing desk. I was surprised by how short the cord came.</p>

			 <p>UV feels like one of those old infomercials where it solves everything, which is where we have landed in the Python world.</p>
<p>I have had several discussions with friends about UV, and even when we talk about it during my weekly(ish) office hours, the list has grown to an ever-growing number of options.</p>
<p>UV started as a quicker way of installing Python packages, and now it&rsquo;s easier to tell people that UV does everything and to focus on what it doesn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>My favorite feature is that UV can now bootstrap a project to run on a machine that does not previously have Python installed, along with installing any packages your application might require.</p>
<p>Here is my incomplete list of what UV does today:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv pip install</code> replaces pip install</li>
<li><code>uv venv</code> replaces <code>python -m venv</code></li>
<li><code>uv pip compile</code> replaces pip-tools compile</li>
<li><code>uv pip sync</code> replaces pip-tools sync</li>
<li><code>uv run</code> replaces pipx</li>
<li><code>uv tool run</code> replaces pipx</li>
<li><code>uv python</code> replaces pyenv, asdf, mise, and several other like-minded tools</li>
<li><code>uv build</code> - Build your Python package for pypi</li>
<li><code>uv publish</code> - Upload your Python package to pypi</li>
<li><code>astral-sh/setup-uv</code> brings UV to GitHub Actions</li>
<li><code>ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest</code> brings UV and Python to Docker</li>
</ul>
<p>I copied these four from <code>uv --help</code>, which feels like poetry features.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv add</code> - Add dependencies to the project</li>
<li><code>uv remove</code> - Remove dependencies from the project</li>
<li><code>uv sync</code> - Update the project&rsquo;s environment</li>
<li><code>uv lock</code> - Update the project&rsquo;s lockfile</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="so-what-doesnt-uv-do">So what doesn&rsquo;t UV do?</h2>
<p>UV does a lot, but it still needs to do everything.</p>
<ul>
<li>UV doesn&rsquo;t run custom scripts defined in our <code>pyproject.toml</code> like <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-run-script"><code>npm-run-script</code></a> allows. Thank you to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@command_tab@hachyderm.io/113422203525133302">@command_tab</a> for jogging my memory.</li>
<li>UV doesn&rsquo;t convert my non-UV-based projects to UV. Converting is more about prefixing and replacing my commands to switch over.</li>
<li>UV doesn&rsquo;t manage, and bump version numbers like the <a href="https://github.com/mbarkhau/bumpver">BumpVer</a>, and others do.</li>
<li>UV doesn&rsquo;t manage <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/">pre-commit</a> like hooks. This is a long shot, but I&rsquo;d love to see support via <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</li>
<li>UV doesn&rsquo;t replace Python, nor should it.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>Friends, I encourage you to publish more, indirectly meaning you should write more and then share it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be best to publish your work in some evergreen space where you control the domain and URL. Then publish on masto-sky-formerly-known-as-linked-don and any place you share and comment on.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to change the world with every post. You might publish a quick thought or two that helps encourage someone else to try something new, listen to a new song, or binge-watch a new series.</p>
<p>This week, I have encouraged at least half a dozen people to blog something, and at least three of them were happily surprised to see their work re-posted by another friend or published in a newsletter.</p>
<p>I have nothing against masto-whatever-you-use-this-week or blue-sky-levels-of-vc-money or formerly-called-no-one-cares, but those platforms are hard to share an article on.</p>
<p>So, even if you re-publish to thread your post infinitely, please find a cheap or free publishing platform and own your work. GitHub Pages is a free way to publish your work via GitHub, and they will let you use your own domain name for free.</p>
<h2 id="you-dont-need-an-editor">You don&rsquo;t need an editor</h2>
<p>I used to ask my friends to review my work, and I still sometimes do. Then I realized that 99% of the time, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I pay for <a href="https://www.grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> because I have Dyslexia, and it helps me communicate better. But you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>You can use a free tool like <a href="https://languagetool.org">LanguageTool</a>, which has an online version that will let you copy and paste your writing into a free, no-login-required Grammar checker. This is more than the average person will do, and it&rsquo;s a quick and free gut check.</p>
<h2 id="not-every-gift-needs-a-bow">Not every gift needs a bow</h2>
<p>Our posts are done when you say they are. You do not have to fret about sticking to landing and having a perfect conclusion. Your posts, like this post, are done after we stop writing.</p>
<hr>
<p>PS: Write and publish before you write your own static site generator or perfect blogging platform. We have lost billions of good writers to this side quest because they spend all their time working on the platform instead of writing.</p>

<p>There are no feature branches‚Äîonly a main branch.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t open pull requests or spend time on the dozens or hundreds of open pull requests.</p>
<p>The commit message stream is nothing but &ldquo;updates&rdquo; or &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; commit subjects.</p>
<p>They leave you feeling that each commitment will be the last before they never touch the project again.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t playing by any rules because they are only focused on the problem they are working on.</p>
<p>They owe us nothing, and yet they are sharing their work.</p>
<p>The project is only complete after they have scratched the itch and moved on to another project.</p>

<p>More and more of my clients are using Justfiles, and occasionally, I want some other recipes that may belong outside the default workflows. These can also be reusable between projects for some of my other internal tooling, so it&rsquo;s an excellent resource to learn about.</p>

			 <p>My new Python application <a href="https://pypi.org/project/files-to-claude-xml/">files-to-claude-xml</a> is now on PyPI, which means they are packaged and pip installable. My preferred way of running <code>files-to-claude-xml</code> is via UV&rsquo;s tool run, which will install it if it still needs to be installed and then execute it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ uv tool run files-to-claude-xml --version
</code></pre></div><h2 id="publishing-on-pypi-with-uv">Publishing on PyPi with UV</h2>
<p>UV has both build and publish commands, so I took them for a spin today.</p>
<p><code>uv build</code> just worked, and a Python package was built.</p>
<p>When I tried <code>uv publish</code>, it prompted me for some auth settings for which I had to log in to <a href="https://pypi.org">PyPI</a> to create a token.</p>
<p>I added those to my local ENV variables I manage with <a href="https://direnv.net">direnv</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">export UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>&lt;your-PyPI-token-here&gt;

</code></pre></div><p>Once both were set and registered, <code>uv publish</code> published my files on PyPI.</p>
<h2 id="github-action">GitHub Action</h2>
<p>To make <code>files-to-claude-xml</code> easier to run on GitHub, I created a custom action to build a <code>_claude.xml</code> from the GitHub repository.</p>
<p>To use this action, I wrote this example workflow, which runs from <a href="https://github.com/jefftriplett/files-to-claude-xml-example">files-to-claude-xml-example</a></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My oldest kiddo and I finished The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom tonight. The 2D Zelda games are some of my favorite games of all time.</p>
<p>I was worried about the game&rsquo;s overall look. It looked too much like Link&rsquo;s Awakening, which I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of compared to the GameBoy version.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to say the screenshots don&rsquo;t do the game justice. They perfected their 2D engine and included some camera control, which helps prevent disappearing into the shadows and behind objects.</p>
<p>The game feels like a sequel to 90s SNES A Link to the Past game with some features from the more recent Switch 3D Zeldas and lore. They even built off of the original Zelda&rsquo;s 2D dungeon side-scrolling mode in a way that I thought was a lot of fun without dreading it.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m happy to see Zelda finally get her own game, I thought the character had a lot of depth and one of the most interesting sets of powers and echoes, which allows for a dizzyingly large number of monsters and objects that Zelda can conjure on demand.</p>
<p>My only complaint was that I snagged a Lynel within the first few hours of play, but I only had enough power right before the last battle of the game to conjure it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy that they thought out post-ending gameplay to make finding everything you missed easier, which was refreshing, instead of being stuck in a weird state.</p>
<p>Echoes of Wisdom might be my favorite 2D(ish) Zelda game and one of my favorite Zelda games.</p>
<p>I hope Nintendo lets Grezzo, the game studio behind it, continue to make weird, 2D Zelda games. This game makes me want to explore the studio&rsquo;s other Nintendo 3DS Zelda games that I missed out on.</p>

		<a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/10/12/i-released-filestoclaudexml-and-new/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-10-12 14:00:31 -0500">Oct 12, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After months of using and sharing this tool via a private gist, I finally carved out some time to release <a href="https://github.com/jefftriplett/files-to-claude-xml">files-to-claude-xml</a>.</p>
<p>Despite my social media timeline declaring LLMs dead earlier today, I have used <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects">Claude Projects</a> and Artifacts.</p>
<p>My workflow is to copy a few files into a Claude Project and then create a new chat thread where Claude will help me write tests or build out a few features.</p>
<p>My <code>files-to-claude-xml</code> script grew out of some research I did where I stumbled on their <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/long-context-tips#essential-tips-for-long-context-prompts">Essential tips for long context prompts</a> which documents how to get around some file upload limits which encourages uploading one big file using Claude&rsquo;s XML-like format.</p>
<p>With <code>files-to-claude-xml</code>, I build a list of files that I want to import into a Claude Project. Then, I run it to generate a <code>_claude.xml</code> file, which I drag into Claude. I create a new conversation thread per feature, then copy the finished artifacts out of Claude once my feature or thread is complete.</p>
<p>After the feature is complete, I delete the <code>_claude.xml</code> file from my project and replace it with an updated copy after I re-run <code>files-to-claude-xml</code>.</p>
<h2 id="features-on-the-go">Features on the go</h2>
<p>One bonus of using Claude Projects is that once everything is uploaded, I can use the Claude iOS app as a sort-of notes app and development tool. I can start parallel conversation threads and have it work on new ideas and features. Once I get back to my desktop, I can pull these chat conversations up, and if I like the direction of the feature, I might use them. If not, I have wasted no time or effort on them. This also serves as a nice ToDo list.</p>
<h2 id="new-workflows">New workflows</h2>
<p>I am working on side projects further using this methodology. Sometimes, I would like to work on something casually while watching Netflix, but my brain shuts off from coding during the day. Instead of feeling bad that I haven&rsquo;t added share links to a website or some feature I meant to add last week, I can pair Claude to work on it with me.</p>
<p>I can also get more done with my lunch hours on projects like <a href="https://djangotv.com">DjangoTV</a> than I could have otherwise. Overall, I&rsquo;m happy to have an on-demand assistant to pair with and work on new features and ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also quicker to try out new ideas and projects that I would have needed to make time for.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>
<p>Simon Willison wrote <a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a>, which I think is also worth trying. I contributed to the discussion, feedback, and document structure for the <code>--cxml</code> feature.</p>
<p>I wrote <code>files-to-claude-xml</code> before Simon had cxml support and hoped to not release my version.</p>
<p>However, after trying it out on several projects, my ignore/exclude list grew more significant than the files that I wanted to include in my project to send to Claude. I found it easier to generate a list of files to pass to mine instead of maintaining a long list to exclude.</p>

			 <p>For my personal <a href="https://github.com/jefftriplett/jefftriplett">GitHub profile</a>, I list my activities, affiliations, and the latest updates from some of my projects.</p>
<p>Historically, I have used <a href="https://github.com/JasonEtco/rss-to-readme">JasonEtco/rss-to-readme</a> GitHub Action to fetch a few RSS feeds or two and to update my README a few times a day.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m happy with this setup. I used it on the Django News GitHub Organization to pull in newsletter issues, jobs, and the latest videos from our various projects. When I tried to install rss-to-readme in our repo, I was getting node12 errors. (Have I mentioned how much I loathe node/npm?).</p>
<p>Instead of forking rss-to-readme and trying to figure out how to upgrade it, I used this as an excuse to &ldquo;pair program&rdquo; with <a href="https://claude.ai">Claude</a>. We quickly built out a prototype using Python and the <a href="https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser">feedparser</a> library.</p>
<p>I would share the chat log, but it&rsquo;s mostly me trying out a few different ways to invoke it before I settle on the finished approach. See the source code over on GitHub if you are curious: <a href="https://github.com/django-news/.github/blob/main/fetch-rss.py">https://github.com/django-news/.github/blob/main/fetch-rss.py</a></p>
<p>Once I had a working Python script that could fetch an RSS file and modify the README, I decided to run/deploy it using <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">UV</a> to see how minimal I could build out the GitHub Action.</p>
<h2 id="github-action">GitHub Action</h2>
<p>To run our <code>fetch-rss.py</code> script, we have four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>actions/checkout</code> Get a git checkout of our project.</li>
<li><code>astral-sh/setup-uv</code> Setup UV also installs Pythons for us. As a bonus, we enabled UV&rsquo;s cache support, which will run much faster in the future unless we change something in our fetch-rss.py file.</li>
<li>Run <code>uv run fetch-rss.py ...</code> to fetch our RSS feeds and write them to disk. <code>uv run</code> installs any dependencies and caches them before our <code>fetch-rss.py</code> runs.</li>
<li><code>stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action</code> If our README.md file has changed, save our changes and commit them back to git and into our README.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our <code>schedule.yml</code> GitHub Action workflow runs twice daily or whenever we push a new change to our repo. We also set <code>workflow_dispatch,</code> which gives us a button to run the script manually.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m pleased with this solution. If I wanted to spend more time on it or re-use this workflow, I might turn it into a GitHub Action workflow so that we can call: <code>django-news/rss-to-readme</code> to use in other projects. For now, this is fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy with the <code>astral-sh/setup-uv</code> and <code>uv run</code> steps because they save me from having to set up Python and then install our project dependencies as separate steps.</p>
<p>I normally shy away from running Python workflows like this in GitHub Actions because they involve a lot of slow steps. This entire workflow takes 16 to 20 seconds to run, which feels fast to me.</p>

			 <p>Friends, I&rsquo;m launching a half-finished website idea that I have been playing around with for a while. <a href="https://djangotv.com">djangotv.com</a> is focused on promoting and searching Django videos to make discovery easier.</p>
<p>I wanted to launch DjangoTV before I left DjangoCon US 2024, so I&rsquo;m technically announcing it from the airport. Last year, I launched <a href="https://jobs.django-news.com">Django News Jobs</a> during the Django sprints because I was annoyed by the state of the various Django job boards.</p>
<p>After a year of hearing people complain about Django and Python YouTube videos not getting enough views, I decided to address the problem by building out a website to help organize and promote them.</p>
<p>DjangoTV is not competing with pyvideo.org. PyVideo is a fantastic resource for the Python community, and one of my goals is to make it easier to get Django content on PyVideo, too.</p>
<p>DjangoTV is incomplete, and I have many ideas to improve it, including backfilling some of our older conferences, adding presenters, and adding some other metadata to make it a useful community resource.</p>
<p>I focused on DjangoCon videos to bootstrap the project, and we&rsquo;ll slowly expand our archives. I have been extracting good quotes, adding transcriptions, and adding better summaries. Please expect this to change a lot. I even launched the website with DEBUG turned on for a few days before I turned it off.</p>
<p>Your feedback is crucial to us. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to share them.</p>
<p>Most importantly, names change, people change, and bodies change. It&rsquo;s essential to me that we respect each other and handle this with care. If you have a concern or need us to pull a video, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out; we will take care of it.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m heading to Durham, NC, for seven days of <a href="https://2024.djangocon.us">DjangoCon US</a> this Friday. This is my 10th year volunteering and the 9th year that <a href="https://www.defna.org">DEFNA</a>, the non-profit I co-founded, has run a DjangoCon US event. Here is an overview of the week.</p>
<h2 id="black-python-devs-leadership-summit-saturday">Black Python Devs Leadership Summit (Saturday)</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m attending and speaking on a discussion panel on Saturday at the <a href="https://blackpythondevs.com/leadership-summit-2024/">Black Python Devs Leadership Summit</a>. Tickets are free, and they will be streaming online in the afternoon. Donations are accepted and appreciated.</p>
<h2 id="django-girls-durham-saturday">Django Girls Durham (Saturday)</h2>
<p><a href="https://djangogirls.org/en/durham/">Django Girls</a> are hosting a Django workshop and teaching beginners a crash course on building their first website using Django.</p>
<h2 id="djangocon-us-tutorials-sunday">DjangoCon US Tutorials (Sunday)</h2>
<p>On Sunday morning, I&rsquo;ll be volunteering and helping out at the tutorials. In the afternoon, we have a tradition of stuffing swag bags, which takes a big group and is a fun way to kick off the conference. You do not need a tutorial ticket or an organizer to help out. Ask at the registration desk, and they can direct you to when and where we are doing this.</p>
<h2 id="django-social-meetup-sunday">Django Social meetup (Sunday)</h2>
<p>My company <a href="https://www.revsys.com">REVSYS</a> is sponsoring a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/djangosocial-raleighdurham/events/303526332//attendees/">DjangoSocial Raleigh/Durham Pre-DjangoCon Special</a> meetup on Sunday evening before the conference kicks off. The meetup will be great for meeting other attendees the night before the conference.</p>
<h2 id="djangocon-us-talks-monday-through-wednesday">DjangoCon US Talks (Monday through Wednesday)</h2>
<p>The talks are great, but the busiest three days of the conference are also the busiest. There is always a lot going on, from sun up to sun down.</p>
<h2 id="djangocon-us-sprints-thursday-and-friday">DjangoCon US Sprints (Thursday and Friday)</h2>
<p>The sprints are one of my favorite parts of the conference. In past years, I have been so exhausted by the sprints that it&rsquo;s hard to sit down and focus. It&rsquo;s one of the best times to discuss Django and the Django ecosystem. If you have a project or want to find a project to help with, the sprints are great for getting your feet wet.</p>
<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>
<p>Tickets are still available if you live near Durham and want to attend. Both events have online and in-person options, so there is no pressure to make last-minute travel plans.</p>
<p>If you live around Durham and want to meet up, please reach out. Let&rsquo;s see if we can meet for coffee.</p>

		<a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/09/19/uv-roundup-five-good-articles/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-09-19 14:18:30 -0500">Sep 19, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have written quite a bit about <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/categories/uv/">UV</a> on my <a href="https://micro.webology.dev">micro blog</a>, and I am happy to see more and more people adopt it. I have stumbled on so many good articles recently that I wanted to share them because every article points out something new or different about why UV works well for them.</p>
<p>If you are new to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">UV</a>, it&rsquo;s a new tool written by <a href="https://astral.sh/">Astral</a>, the creators of <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff">Ruff</a>.</p>
<p>I like UV because it replaces, combines, or complements a bunch of Python tools into one tool and user developer experience without forcing a UV way of doing it. UV effectively solves the question, &ldquo;Why do I need another Python tool?&rdquo; to do everyday Python tasks.</p>
<p>Some reason I like UV after using it for months:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a faster pip and is really, really fast</li>
<li>It can install and manage Python versions</li>
<li>It can run and install Python scripts</li>
<li>It can run single-file Python scripts along with their dependencies</li>
<li>It can handle project lock files</li>
</ul>
<p>While some people don&rsquo;t care about UV being fast, it&rsquo;s shaved minutes off my CI builds and container rebuilds, which means it has also saved me money and energy resources.</p>
<h2 id="overall-thoughts-on-uv">Overall thoughts on UV</h2>
<p>Oliver Andrich&rsquo;s <a href="https://andrich.me/2024/09/uv-i-am-somewhat-sold/">UV ‚Äî I am (somewhat) sold</a> takes the approach of only using UV to set up a new Python environment. Oliver uses UV to install Python, aliases to call Python, and UV tool install to set up a few global utilities.</p>
<h2 id="using-uv-with-django">Using UV with Django</h2>
<p>An≈æe Peƒçar&rsquo;s <a href="https://blog.pecar.me/uv-with-django">UV with Django</a> shows how to use UV to set up a new project with Django.</p>
<h2 id="switching-from-pyenv-to-uv">Switching from pyenv to UV</h2>
<p>Will Guaraldi Kahn-Greene&rsquo;s <a href="https://bluesock.org/~willkg/blog/dev/switch_pyenv_to_uv.html">Switching from pyenv to uv</a> was relatable for me because I also use pyenv, but I plan to slowly migrate to using only UV. I&rsquo;m already halfway there, but I will have pyenv for my legacy projects for years because many aren&rsquo;t worth porting yet.</p>
<h2 id="using-uv-and-managing-with-ansible">Using UV and managing with Ansible</h2>
<p>Adam Johnson&rsquo;s <a href="https://adamj.eu/tech/2024/09/18/python-uv-development-setup/">Python: my new uv setup for development</a> taught me to use <code>uv cache prune</code> to clean up unused cache entries and shows how he manages his UV setup using Ansible.</p>

<p>Simon Willison&rsquo;s <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/15/uv-i-am-somewhat-sold/">Notes on UV</a> is an excellent summary of Oliver&rsquo;s notes.</p>
<h2 id="a-parting-uv-tip">A parting UV tip</h2>
<p>If you are a pre-commit fan hoping for a version that supports UV, the <a href="https://github.com/tox-dev/pre-commit-uv"><code>pre-commit-uv</code></a> project does just that. I started updating my justfile recipes to bake <code>just lint</code> to the following <code>uv run</code> command, which speeds up running and installing pre-commit significantly.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>üéí While some of my friends and colleagues can pack everything they need in a small backpack for a week&rsquo;s travel, I am not that person.</p>
<p>I turned into the person who brings their pillow when they travel, and it changed my stay and quality of sleep by 1000%.</p>
<p>There are many variables you can&rsquo;t control when you travel, but the pillow is the one variable I can control, and it has the biggest impact on my overall sleep quality. It&rsquo;s frustrating to pay $200 or more a night for a nice hotel room and then to have a lousy night of sleep because of a flat pillow.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t control the mattress quality you sleep on, but having a decent pillow takes the edge off for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also an excellent excuse to buy a new pillow for your home in case your bag gets damaged, something happens to your pillow, and you need to throw your old pillow away. That also eases the burden so you can throw your travel pillow in the wash as soon as you get back without disrupting your first night back home.</p>
<p>In conclusion, you can bring your own pillow if you struggle with sleep while traveling. It&rsquo;s a relatively cheap life hack that might require a slightly bigger bag, but it might be worth it for improved sleep quality.</p>

</a> Stack Report before I have a firm opinion, but I saw his <a href="https://mastodon.social/@carlton@fosstodon.org/113113728832109272">Mastodon post</a> and I thought it was worth sharing some initial thoughts.</p>
<p>On my first read, I fell into the camp that wants <code>django-unique-user-email</code> and full name to be the defaults on Django&rsquo;s built-in User. I have wanted this forever, and my clients do, too.</p>
<p>Django should still allow me to create a custom user, but the documentation could be better. Django&rsquo;s documentation is a topic for another day, but I&rsquo;m confused by it and find it less and less helpful. I notice the developers I work with get lost in them, too. Docs may be a good DjangoCon US topic if you want to discuss it in a few weeks.</p>
<p>I would love the default User to have a unique email address, full name, and a short name. Optionally, a username is an email address setting. Please don&rsquo;t take away the ability to have a custom User model. (<strong>Update:</strong> Carlton is <em>not</em> making a case for removing a custom User model, but others have made that argument. No, thank you.)</p>
<p>Carlton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Action points&rdquo; conclusion seems reasonable to me.</p>

			 <p>My ThermoWorks Signals thermometer&rsquo;s battery was dead, so I connected it to my Anker 737 Power Bank (24,000mAh for the curious) to get me by.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Previously, I mounted a Wyze camera on a tripod and pointed it toward my thermometer because its Bluetooth connection wasn&rsquo;t strong enough. WiFi worked fine for the camera, but our smoker is in our backyard and has to go through two external walls to reach any of our devices.</p>
<p>This worked well during the early pandemic when I was working from home. I could check the camera from my upstairs office or couch without worrying about the weather. As a bonus, I could see the front panel of my Pitbos Smoker to monitor it in case it ran out of wood pellets or the heat source went out. I could have bought the fancy ThermoWorks Signals thermometer, but a $20 Wyze Camera worked better.</p>
<p>Today, I have the fancy thermometer, and I still should have connected the Wyze cam because the smoker ran out of pellets, which delayed dinner by 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Maybe I will use this as an excuse to explore one of Ollama&rsquo;s Vision libraries like <a href="https://ollama.com/library/llava">LLaVA</a> to read photos from the Wyze Camera and the smoker to let me know when something goes wrong.</p>

<p>I have written a few throw-away scripts, which William Vincent wrote about and updated a few times in the <a href="https://learndjango.com/tutorials/essential-django-3rd-party-packages">Top 10 Django Third-Party Packages (2024)</a> and <a href="https://learndjango.com/tutorials/10-most-used-django-packages">The 10 Most-Used Django Packages (2024)</a>.</p>
<p>These efforts are powered by <a href="https://github.com/hugovk/">Hugo van Kemenade</a>&rsquo;s excellent <a href="https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/">Top PyPI Packages</a>.</p>
<p>This inspired me to fork Brian&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/okken/top-pytest-plugins">top-pytest-plugins</a> project, which I updated to support passing in other package names like &ldquo;django&rdquo; to get a rough estimate of monthly package downloads.</p>
<p>The refactored project is <a href="https://github.com/jefftriplett/top-python-packages">jefftriplett/top-python-packages</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Looking at the package name doesn&rsquo;t scale as well for projects that have their own <a href="https://pypi.org/classifiers/">Trove classifiers</a>. For a project like pytest, it works well. Many of the top packages may not even have Django in their name for a project like Django. Some projects may even actively discourage a project from using their project in their package&rsquo;s name for trademark reasons. So, YMMV applies here.</p>
<h2 id="prompts">Prompts</h2>
<p>I added <code>uv run</code> support, which I have <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/categories/uv/">written about a lot lately</a>.</p>
<p>I also copied the <code>top_pytest.py</code> file into a Claude 3.5 Sonnet session, and I let it handle the whole refactor. It even handled adding the <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/">PEP 723</a> new package dependencies without me asking it to.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/08/21/uv-updates-and-pep-simplifying/">üêç UV Updates and PEP 723: Simplifying Python Packaging and Scripting</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/08/21/uv-updates-and-pep-simplifying/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-08-21 22:57:49 -0500">Aug 21, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The <a href="https://astral.sh/blog/uv-unified-python-packaging">uv: Unified Python packaging</a> update brings fresh air to the Python community, with several improvements streamlining the development process. One exciting addition is an early preview of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/">PEP 723</a>, also known as <a href="https://astral.sh/blog/uv-unified-python-packaging#single-file-scripts">Single-file scripts</a>.</p>
<p>The Single-file scripts feature particularly caught my attention due to its potential to simplify the distribution and execution of small Python projects. Streamlining the process is highly appealing to someone who frequently creates GitHub Gists and shares them privately and publicly.</p>
<p>With this new feature, I can now instruct users to run <code>uv run main.py</code> without explaining what a <code>venv</code> or <code>virtualenv</code> is, plus a long list of requirements that need to be passed to <code>pip install</code>.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to test this feature over lunch today. While adding libraries to the script was straightforward, I encountered a few hurdles when I forgot to invoke <code>uv run</code> in my virtual environment (venv). This makes sense, given that it&rsquo;s a new habit, but it highlights the importance of adapting to changes in our development workflow.</p>
<p>Overall, the UV: Unified Python packaging update and the introduction of Single-file scripts mark a significant step in simplifying Python development. As developers become more familiar with these improvements, we expect increased adoption and smoother collaboration on small-scale projects.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-example">Bonus Example</h2>
<p>I looked through some of my recent visits, and one I recently shared with a few conference organizer friends was a one-off script I used to read several YouTube video JSON files that I&rsquo;m using to bootstrap another project. It was the first time I used <a href="https://duckdb.org">DuckDB</a> to make quick work of reading data from a bunch of JSON files using SQL.</p>
<p>Overall, I was happy with DuckDB and what PEP 723 might bring to the future of Python apps, even if my example only does a little.</p>

<p>PEP 723 also opens the door to turning a one-file Python script into a runnable Docker image that doesn&rsquo;t even need Python on the machine or opens the door for <a href="https://beeware.org">Beeware</a> and <a href="https://beeware.org/project/projects/tools/briefcase/">Briefcase</a> to build standalone apps.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Here are my thoughts on John Gruber&rsquo;s recent article and notes on the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/14/us-google-breakup">Google Monopoly</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I mean, let‚Äôs say Google was forced to spin Chrome off. How would Chrome Inc. make money? Clearly, they‚Äôd make money through TAC fee payments from Google search. &gt;Also, if they split off Chrome they‚Äôd almost have to split off Android.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chrome Inc will be quite profitable, making $20 billion a year from Alphabet to set Google Search as the default search engine on Chrome. The same model works for Android Inc, too.</p>
<p>The Justice Department doesn&rsquo;t exist to figure out Alphabet&rsquo;s business model nor does it care to. The fact that everything is so tied together that it&rsquo;s hard to split up doesn&rsquo;t is only further proof that Google is a monopoly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Google is disallowed from making its own web browser how in the world can they make an OS? I mean in theory they could make an OS that only offered third-party browsers but that would mean no system-level webview for apps to embed. Some people laughed at Microsoft‚Äôs late-1990s argument that Windows needed a built-in browser but that‚Äôs obviously true today. It‚Äôs no different than including a TCP/IP networking stack or printer drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The OS which is Linux based can go with Chrome. Google doesn&rsquo;t need their own OS to work on Mac, iOS, Windows, and other operating system they run their products on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don‚Äôt know what the remedy ought to be for this case, but I don‚Äôt think a breakup is it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A breakup is better for consumers. Google&rsquo;s stranglehold on the online ad industry will feel painful after it&rsquo;s broken up. The only reason it feels hard to break Google into so many new companies is because it&rsquo;s such a one-sided monopoly. However, that doesn&rsquo;t justify not breaking them up.</p>
<p>Google has a long history of pushing technology that is only good for Google. Does anyone remember <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23711172/google-amp-accelerated-mobile-pages-search-publishers-lawsuit">AMP</a> and how Google forced the publishing industry to jump to a platform that only benefited them?</p>
<p>It makes sense to chop Alphabet + Google into dozens of smaller companies. Chrome, Android, Gmail, Docs (maybe Maps), and hardware should stand independently. Search and Ads should each be divided into multiple companies. The goal isn&rsquo;t to make business sense; it is to divide the company into parts that compete against themselves.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2024/aug/07/django-51-released/">Django 5.1 was released</a>, and I was reminded of the article I wrote earlier this year about <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/02/01/choosing-the-right.html">Choosing the Right Python and Django Versions for Your Projects</a>.</p>
<p>While I encouraged you to wait until the second, third, or even fourth patch release of Django and Python before upgrading, I received a bit of pushback. One interesting perspective claimed that if everyone waits to upgrade, we don&rsquo;t find critical bugs until the later versions. While that may be plausible, I don&rsquo;t believe that the dozens of people who read my blog will be swayed by my recommendation to wait for a few patch releases.</p>
<p>I could have emphasized the potential risks of not testing early. Please start testing during the alpha and release candidate phase so that when Django 5.1 is released, your third-party applications will be ready and working on launch day, minimizing the risk of last-minute issues.</p>
<p>Today, I tried to upgrade <a href="https://djangopackages.org">Django Packages</a> to run on Django 5.1 to see if our test suite would run on Django 5.1, and it very quickly failed in CI due to at least one package not supporting 5.1 yet. Even if it had passed, I&rsquo;m 90% sure another package would have failed because that&rsquo;s the nature of running a new major Django or Python release on day one. Even if the third-party package is ready, the packaging ecosystem needs time to catch up.</p>
<h2 id="which-version-of-django-should-i-use-today">Which version of Django should I use today?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m sticking with <strong>Django 5.0</strong> until Django 5.1&rsquo;s ecosystem has caught up. I plan to update the third-party packages I help maintain to have Django 5.1 support. After a few patch releases of Django 5.1 have come out and the ecosystem has time to catch up, I will try to migrate again.</p>
<h2 id="which-version-of-python-should-i-use-today">Which version of Python should I use today?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting new projects on <strong>Python 3.12</strong>, with a few legacy projects still being done on Python 3.11. While I am adding Django 5.1 support, I plan to add Python 3.13 support in my testing matrixes to prepare everything for Python 3.13&rsquo;s release this fall.</p>
<h2 id="office-hours">Office hours</h2>
<p>I plan to spend some of my <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/categories/office-hours/">Office Hours</a> this week working on Django 5.1 and Python 3.13 readiness for projects I maintain. Please join me if you have a project to update or would like some light-hearted banter to end your week.</p>

		<a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/08/06/google-search-speculation/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-08-06 20:34:23 -0500">Aug 6, 2024</time></a>

			 <p>Eric Holscher posted this <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ericholscher@fosstodon.org/112917186548638471">post</a> today, and I wanted to share my speculation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Calling it now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google stops paying Apple &amp; Mozilla for search</li>
<li>Apple ships search (probably buys DDG or similar)</li>
<li>Apple pays Mozilla to be default search engine</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="google-stops-paying-apple--mozilla-for-search">Google stops paying Apple &amp; Mozilla for search</h2>
<p>This judgment means that Google has to give up overpaying to be the default search engine for Apple and Mozilla. It&rsquo;s the primary basis of the lawsuit, and the judge wrote a 300-page judgment. So, it&rsquo;s safe to say it will happen even if Alphabet isn&rsquo;t formally broken up.</p>
<h2 id="apple-ships-search-probably-buys-ddg-or-similar">Apple ships search (probably buys DDG or similar)</h2>
<p>Short term: Because Apple already has an AI deal with Google, I expect Apple&rsquo;s default search to stay the same despite Google not being able to pay them for that default. Apple will change the options menu, but Google will remain the default.</p>
<p>Long shot/Longer term: Apple buys a few search companies and creates its own search products, as it did with Apple Maps. Search isn&rsquo;t going to look like Google search does today, or, better yet, it looked like a decade ago before it because of an ad-first search secondary service.</p>
<h2 id="apple-pays-mozilla-to-be-default-search-engine">Apple pays Mozilla to be default search engine</h2>
<p>I do not see this happening even if Mozilla spends most of its cash buying a search company. Mozilla won&rsquo;t be able to pay Apple to use it, and they need an incentive to switch. Logistically, Mozilla would cease to exist before this could happen.</p>
<p>Apple doesn&rsquo;t want to be a search company or incorporate ads like Google and Meta do with their products. Even Apple TV&rsquo;s ads are mostly for other Apple TV content.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-mozilla">What about Mozilla?</h2>
<p>Mozilla will either pivot to try to buy or partner with Kagi, DDG, or Brave (gross, but the most likely). The Mozilla Foundation is facing a potentially extinction-level event, but it has a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-05/why-google-keeps-paying-mozilla-s-firefox-even-as-chrome-dominates">billion-dollar nest egg</a> to fall back on.</p>
<p>Mozilla has cash, but its options may not resemble the Mozilla Foundation we know today.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAfter having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,‚Äù the ruling states.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/05/google-loses-antitrust-lawsuit">www.theguardian.com/technolog&hellip;</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, Google is a monopoly. They have been for over a decade and closer to two decades.</p>
<p>If this quote from The Verge is true, Google‚Äôs CEO was a pretty damning witness and admitted that Google intentionally froze the ecosystem in place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>¬†The judge found former Google executive Sridhar Ramaswamy ‚Äúa particularly compelling witness,‚Äù pointing to his answer about why Google would pay billions of dollars in revenue share to maintain default status if it already had the best search engine. Ramaswamy told the court that the payments ‚Äúbasically freeze the ecosystem in place.‚Äù
¬†
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24155520/judge-rules-on-us-doj-v-google-antitrust-search-suit">www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/&hellip;</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to The Verge‚Äôs ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù reporting, I can‚Äôt source this quote again, but I pulled it before they removed it and shared it across several Slacks and Discord groups.</p>
<p>As far as Alphabet/Google goes, the US Government should break them up and disassemble the company. That outcome may depend on the result of the 2024 election, but both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are signaling that they intend to follow through.</p>
<p>I suspect Mozilla has the most to lose over this ruling. Google accounts for a significant portion of Mozilla‚Äôs revenue and has historically kept them afloat. However, I suspect the days of Google paying any company to be its default search are numbered.</p>

<p>Why I gave up on Pinboard</p>

<p>This aged well.</p>
<p>I suspect that someday, I will roll out my own commercial Delicious clone for people who just want a reliable bookmark-archiving web service.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I might have said this would be a Pinboard clone, but at least Yahoo knew when to pack it up and shut it down vs. whatever the Pinboard founder has been doing. ü§∑</p>

			 <p>I spent a <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/07/24/ollama-llama-red.html">few hours this week</a> working with the Ollama project and trying to get tool calling to work with the LangChain library.</p>
<p>Tool calling is a way to expose Python functions to a language model that allows them to be called. This will enable models to perform more complex actions and even call the outside world for more information.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t used LangChain before, and I found the whole process frustrating. The docs were full of errors. I eventually figured it out, but I was limited to one tool call per prompt, which felt broken.</p>
<p>Earlier today, I was telling a colleague about it, and when we got back from grabbing coffee, I thought I would check the Ollama Discord channel to see if anyone else had figured it out. To my surprise, they added and released <a href="https://ollama.com/blog/tool-support">Tool support</a> last night, which allowed me to ditch LangChain altogether.</p>
<p>The Ollama project&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python/blob/main/examples/tools/main.py">tool calling example</a> was just enough to help get me started.</p>
<p>I struggled with the function calling syntax, but after digging a bit deeper, I found this example from <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/function-calling">OpenAI&rsquo;s Function calling docs</a>, which matches the format the Ollama project is following. I still don&rsquo;t fully understand it, but I got more functions working and verified that I can make multiple tool calls within the same prompt.</p>
<p>Meta&rsquo;s Llama 3.1 model supports tool calling, and the two work quite well together. I am also impressed with Llama 3.1 and the large context window support. I&rsquo;m running the 8B and 70B models on a Mac Studio, and they feel very close to the commercial APIs I have worked with, but I can run them locally.</p>
<h2 id="embedding-models">Embedding models</h2>
<p>Tonight, I tried out Ollama&rsquo;s <a href="https://ollama.com/blog/embedding-models">Embedding models</a> example, and while I got it working, I still need to put practical data into it to give it a better test</p>
<h2 id="one-more-tip">One more tip</h2>
<p>If you did not know Ollama can parse and return valid JSON, check out <a href="https://whoa.fyi/how-to-get-json-response-from-ollama/">How to get JSON response from Ollama</a>. It made my JSON parsing and responses much more reliable.</p>

<p>I have two Macs running Ollama and I use <a href="https://tailscale.com">Tailscale</a> to bounce between them from anywhere. When I&rsquo;m at home upstairs it&rsquo;s quicker to run a local instance. When I&rsquo;m on my 2019 MacBook Pro it&rsquo;s faster to connect to the office.</p>
<p>The only stumbling block I ran into was needing to set a few ENV variables setup so that Ollama is listening on a port that I can proxy to. This was frustrating to figure out, but I hope it saves you some time.</p>

<p>While I was working on this post, Mistral AI launched their <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-large-2407/">Large Enough: Mistral Large 2</a>  model today. The Ollama project released <a href="https://ollama.com/library/mistral-large">support for the model</a> within minutes of its announcement.</p>
<p>The Mistral Large 2 release is noteworthy because it outperforms Lllama 3.1&rsquo;s 405B parameter model and is under 1/3 of the size. It is also the second GPT-4 class model release in the last two days.</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago, I wrote about this year&rsquo;s PSF Election, three <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/07/02/on-the-psf.html">proposed bylaws changes</a>, and how I intended to vote. I&rsquo;m happy that the membership overwhelmingly approved all three proposed bylaw changes. Here is this <a href="https://opavote.com/results/5004101476679680">year&rsquo;s results</a>.</p>
<h2 id="merging-contributing-and-managing-member-classes">Merging Contributing and Managing member classes</h2>
<p>This change is a good step toward consolidating two membership classes and a commitment to acknowledging that all community contributions are important, not just code contributions.</p>
<h2 id="simplifying-the-voter-affirmation-process-by-treating-past-voting-activity-as-intent-to-continue-voting">Simplifying the voter affirmation process by treating past voting activity as intent to continue voting</h2>
<p>If you voted in last year&rsquo;s election, there are fewer barriers to voting in the next election. With a 76% turnout this year, I suspect next year will still yield over a 50% voter turnout, and I suspect turnout will continue to be high.</p>
<h2 id="allow-for-removal-of-fellows-by-a-board-vote-in-response-to-code-of-conduct-violations-removing-the-need-for-a-vote-of-the-membership">Allow for removal of Fellows by a Board vote in response to Code of Conduct violations, removing the need for a vote of the membership</h2>
<p>This one means the most to me. When I joined the board, our Code of Conduct was barely two paragraphs long and said little. We rewrote it and formed the PSF Code of Conduct workgroup. From today forward, we can appreciate that the Python Code of Conduct applies to everyone.</p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>We also gained three new directors, including two returning directors. This election may be the first time we have had an election in which no one running from North America made it on the board. (Possibly Europe, too, but I didn&rsquo;t dive as deep to verify that.) Either way, this is a noteworthy milestone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud of the Python community for embracing our Code of Conduct and membership changes. A few of these were overdue, but updating the voter affirmation process is an excellent proactive step and a shift for the board.</p>
<p>I also want to thank D√©bora Azevedo, the PSF&rsquo;s vice chair-elect and our outbound director. I was impressed with D√©bora when we served on the board together, and I thought she brought valuable insights. When she put her name forward to run for vice chair, I was impressed because it&rsquo;s an intimidating group to put yourself out there, and I thought D√©bora managed it well.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Renaming a table in Django seems more complex than it is. Last week, a client asked me how much pain it might be to rename a Django model from Party to Customer. We already used the model&rsquo;s <code>verbose_name</code>, so it has been referencing the new name for months.</p>
<p>Renaming the model should be as easy as renaming the model while updating any foreign key and many-to-many field references in other models and then running Django&rsquo;s <code>make migrations</code> sub-command to see where we are at.</p>
<p>The main issue with this approach is that Django will attempt to create a new table first, update model references, and then drop the old table.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Django will either fail mid-way through this migration and roll the changes back or even worse, it may complete the migration only for you to discover that your new table is empty.</p>
<p>Deleting data is not what we want to happen.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Django supports a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/migration-operations/#renamemodel"><code>RenameModel</code></a> migration option, but it did not prompt me to ask if we wanted to rename Party to Customer.</p>
<p>I am also more example-driven, and the Django docs don&rsquo;t have an example of how to use <code>RenameModel</code>. Thankfully, this migration operation is about as straightforward as one can imagine: <code>class RenameModel(old_model_name, new_model_name)</code></p>
<p>I re-used the existing migration file that Django created for me. I dropped the <code>CreateModel</code> and <code>DeleteModel</code> operations, added a <code>RenameField</code> operation, and kept the <code>RenameField</code> operations which resulted in the following migration:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#f92672">from</span> django.db <span style="color:#f92672">import</span> migrations

    ]
</code></pre></div><p>The story&rsquo;s moral is that you should <em>always check and verify</em> that your Django migrations will perform as you expect before running them in production. Thankfully, we did, even though glossing over them is easy.</p>
<p>I also encourage you to dive deep into the areas of the Django docs where there aren&rsquo;t examples. Many areas of the docs may need examples or even more expanded docs, and they are easy to gloss over or get intimidated by.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be afraid to create and update your migrations by hand. After all, Django migrations are Python code designed to give you a jumpstart. You can and should modify the code to meet your needs. <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/migration-operations/">Migration Operations</a> have a clean API once you dig below the surface and understand what options you have to work with.</p>

At that point, Firefox became bloated and buggy like the Mozilla browser before it, and I found myself at that intersection again.</p>
<p>Last year, I switched to <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> as my <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/04/27/drop-google-chrome.html">default browser</a> and only kept Chrome around for a few organizations.

<p>What annoys me the most is that Mozilla was supposed to be the company that knows better, but their leadership keeps reminding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/16/16784628/mozilla-mr-robot-arg-plugin-firefox-looking-glass">us</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363424/mozilla-layoffs-quarter-staff-250-people-new-revenue-focus">of</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24109116/mozilla-ends-onerep-data-removal-partnership">who</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/13/24072184/mozilla-is-laying-off-around-60-workers-and-scaling-back-its-mastodon-instance">they</a> <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/24/mozilla_product_chief_sues_over/">are</a>.</p>
<p>Removing Firefox pains me because I believe in alternative browsers that aren&rsquo;t controlled by one company. I have friends who have worked for Mozilla in the past and present.</p>
<p>Had Mozilla pledged to cut the bullshit and give me a Firefox Pro option to support them, I would have been one of the first to sign up. However, I don&rsquo;t trust Mozilla when they aren&rsquo;t focused on being the best web browser in the industry. I&rsquo;d rather avoid their antics until they give me a reason to trust them again.</p>
<p>PS: Maybe <a href="https://servo.org">Servo</a> is a better alternative from Mozilla, but for now, <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> is my best Chrome-like, and it&rsquo;s not run by Google until something better emerges.</p>

			 <p>ü§î I haven&rsquo;t fully figured out <a href="https://duckdb.org">DuckDB</a> yet, but it&rsquo;s worth trying out if you are a Python dev who likes to work on data projects or gets frequently tasked with data import projects.</p>
<p>DuckDB is a fast database engine that lets you read CSV, Parquet, and JSON files and query them using SQL. Instead of importing data into your database, DuckDB enables you to write SQL and run it against these file types.</p>
<p>I have a YouTube to frontmatter project that can read a YouTube playlist and write out each video to a markdown file. I modified the export script to save the raw JSON output to disk.</p>
<p>I used DuckDB to read a bunch of JSON files using the following script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> duckdb

<span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span>():
    result <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> duckdb<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>sql(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;SELECT id,snippet FROM read_json(&#39;data/*.json&#39;)&#34;</span>)<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>fetchall()

    <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> row <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> result:
        id, snippet <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> row
        print(<span style="color:#e6db74">f</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">{</span>id<span style="color:#e6db74">=}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>)
        print(snippet[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;channelTitle&#34;</span>])
        print(snippet[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;title&#34;</span>])
        print(snippet[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;publishedAt&#34;</span>])
        print(snippet[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;description&#34;</span>])
        print()


<span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> __name__ <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;__main__&#34;</span>:
    main()
</code></pre></div><p>This script accomplishes several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It reads over 650 JSON files in about one second.</li>
<li>It uses SQL to query the JSON data directly.</li>
<li>It extracts specific fields (id and snippet) from each JSON file.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="performance-and-ease-of-use">Performance and Ease of Use</h2>
<p>The speed at which DuckDB processes these files is remarkable. In traditional setups, reading and parsing this many JSON files could take significantly longer and require more complex code.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-duckdb">When to Use DuckDB</h2>
<p>DuckDB shines in scenarios where you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quickly analyze data in files without a formal import process.</li>
<li>Perform SQL queries on semi-structured data (like JSON)</li>
<li>Process large datasets efficiently on a single machine.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>DuckDB is worth trying out in your data projects. If you have a lot of data and you need help with what to do with it, being able to write SQL against hundreds of files is powerful and flexible.</p>

<p>Last year, I looked forward to upgrading Bartender until their <a href="https://www.macbartender.com/Bartender5/blog/">recent botched communication and messaging</a> regarding the purchase of the app.</p>

<p>The upgrade took less than a minute, and the app worked the same way Bartender did for me. I changed the menu icon to an ellipsis to match what I had the Bartender app set to, and everything worked.</p>

			 <p>One of the fun discoveries of blogging is finding your article in search results while trying to solve a problem.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I upgraded my Macs to macOS to Sonoma, but I hadn&rsquo;t yet re-enabled passwordless authentication via sudo. If this were a server in the cloud, I would approach it differently, but on my laptop, it&rsquo;s a different story, and I can skip re-typing my password.</p>
<p>I stumbled on my <a href="https://jefftriplett.com/2022/enable-sudo-without-a-password-on-macos/">TIL: Enable sudo without a password on MacOS</a> post from 2022 when I was searching for a quick fix.</p>
<p>I also <a href="https://mastodon.social/@webology/112752248397936405">posted on Mastodon</a> about this, which led to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@anthony@indieweb.social/112752290076010862">Anthony&rsquo;s</a> helpful <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/08/in-macos-sonoma-touch-id-for-sudo-can-survive-updates/">suggestion</a> that I could instead use Touch ID which I liked a lot.</p>
<p>I wish I could use Touch ID, but I often use SSH and Remote Desktop. Touch ID will only work if my finger is there. It&rsquo;s still an excellent suggestion for anyone seeking a more secure way to assume sudo access.</p>
<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@d@dryan.com/112753300845939084">Dan Ryan</a> pointed me to a <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/398656/sudoers-file-resets-with-every-macos-update/398669#398669">better solution</a> than my existing workaround, which doesn&rsquo;t get overwritten every major macOS update.</p>
<p>Helpful suggestions like these are why I like to think out loud and share these thoughts on Mastodon.</p>

			 <p>The last week was a blur between the holiday, travel, and cramming a lot of work. My notes this week are more glossed over than most</p>
<h2 id="family">Family</h2>
<p>We drove to Illinois (near Chicago) to see family this week. We had family from both coasts who we don&rsquo;t see very often, and it was the first time much of the family met my youngest, Nora. It takes us 8 to 8.5 hours to drive there, and people are always amazed at how good my kids are at traveling these distances. They both love the extra screen time and are easy to travel with. We can hand each one an iPad, and they are set for hours, given enough snacks and a rest stop every few hours.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>It was a short two-day week, but I got a bonus third day of work between fitting a few hours in the car and half a day on Friday. This was nice because we are wrapping up an existing client project while ramping up on another project.</p>
<p>This has also made me realize that Django has many shopping cart projects, but they all seem to be outdated. We struggled to find a project we could use, which made me realize that the Django community is sorely missing a good shopping cart and checkout experience that works.</p>
<h2 id="community-work">Community Work</h2>
<p><a href="https://djangonaut.space">Djangonaut Space</a>: All three Djangonaut Space Team Neptune members have made meaningful contributions early in the process, and now I&rsquo;m feeling the pressure to detail and share some more advanced projects so they can have tasks for the duration of the project.</p>
<p>Django Code of Conduct WG: We have prioritized keeping up as we get new members used to contributing. This week, was a busy week.</p>
<h2 id="side-projects">Side projects</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://django-news.com">Django News Newsletter</a>:</strong> We shipped issue <a href="https://django-news.com/issues/240#start">#240</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://jobs.django-news.com">Django News Jobs</a>: We have had code to aggregate some other Django job boards, and this week, we started allowing those to come through.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>This week, I was back on track, and I wrote and published something every day. It was my first day of giving myself a buffer so that I am always writing tomorrow&rsquo;s post, which took the edge and pressure off. I am still writing every day, but with the holiday, it was nice knowing I didn&rsquo;t have to fit it in on our last day in Chicago, which ended up being a really long, full day with family.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t use <code>shell_plus</code> often, but I bake it into my Just workflows for clients who do. I tend to forget about it, and I spend so much time using <code>pytest.set_trace()</code> and testing.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t used <code>graph_models</code>, I use it in most of my client projects. I generate SVG files with it and add them to an ERD section of their docs, which helps discuss models and onboard new developers. It&rsquo;s a nice-to-have feature and is a small lift with a huge payoff. This code is also easy to copy and paste from project to project.</p>

			 <p>Yes, <a href="https://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions">Django Extensions</a> package is worth installing, especially for its show_urls command, which can be very useful for debugging and understanding your project&rsquo;s URL configurations.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a short example of how to use it because I sometimes want to include a link to the Django Admin in a menu for staff users, and I am trying to remember what name I need to reference to link to it.</p>
<p>First, you will need to install it via:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">pip install django-extensions

<span style="color:#75715e"># or if you prefer using uv like me:</span>
uv pip install django-extensions
</code></pre></div><p>Next, you&rsquo;ll want to add <code>django_extensions</code> to your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> in your <code>settings.py</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">INSTALLED_APPS <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [
    <span style="color:#f92672">...</span>
    <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;django_extensions&#34;</span>,
]
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, to urn the <code>show_urls</code> management command you may do some by running your <code>manage.py</code> script and passing it the following option:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ python -m manage show_urls
</code></pre></div><p>Which will give this output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ python -m manage show_urls | grep admin
...
/admin/	django.contrib.admin.sites.index	admin:index
/admin/&lt;app_label&gt;/	django.contrib.admin.sites.app_index	admin:app_list
/admin/&lt;url&gt;	django.contrib.admin.sites.catch_all_view
<span style="color:#75715e"># and a whole lot more...</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In this case, I was looking for <code>admin:index</code> which I can now add to my HTML document this menu link/snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">... 
&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">a</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;{% url &#39;admin:index&#39; %}&#34;</span>&gt;Django Admin&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">a</span>&gt;
... 
</code></pre></div><p>What I like about this approach is that I can now hide or rotate the url pattern I&rsquo;m using to get to my admin website, and yet Django will always link to the correct one.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This was written while driving to Chicago (technically from the passenger seat). Still, a few people contacted me and asked me how I vote for PSF directors, so I wanted to share.</p>
<p>If you can vote in the PSF election, please do so before <strong>Tuesday, July 16th, 2024, 2:00 p.m. UTC</strong>. For more details, check out their blog post, <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/07/the-2024-psf-board-election-is-open.html">The 2024 PSF Board Election is Open!</a>  (The blog post lists the date incorrectly as ending on a Friday.)</p>
<p>I served on the PSF board for five years, from 2018 to 2023, and here is what I am looking for when I research who to vote for this year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a harder-than-normal slate of candidates because only three open seats are available, compared to four in the last few years. More candidates are new to me this year than most years.</p>
<p>We also have some solid candidates running, which makes it even harder.</p>
<h2 id="existing-directors">Existing directors</h2>
<p>For existing directors, I look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long have they served on the board?</li>
<li>What positions/roles did they serve while on the board?</li>
<li>What has the PSF accomplished during its term?</li>
<li>What was their meeting attendance like?</li>
<li>I read their previous candidate statements to see if the PSF accomplished what they said they wanted.</li>
<li>How did they treat the PSF&rsquo;s staff in meetings, at events, and behind the scenes?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="all-candidates">All candidates</h2>
<p>For everyone, including existing directors, I read their candidate statements, and then I look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do they value?</li>
<li>What their company and community affiliations are.</li>
<li>Understands and is committed to our Code of Conduct to promote a healthy community.</li>
<li>What workgroups did they participate in?</li>
<li>What are they committed to working on and changing in their next term?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-im-prioritizing">What I&rsquo;m prioritizing</h2>
<p>I prioritize diverse candidates and representation. This includes geographical representation.</p>
<p>I prioritize candidates who <strong>do not work</strong> for Big Tech / FAANG companies. These companies often give raises and promotions to employees who make it on open-source boards. It&rsquo;s a KPI goal for some Dev Rels and I&rsquo;m not here to help any Big Tech companies. Thankfully, I have served with many selfless directors, despite them working for Big Tech companies. Still, you have a right to know when you vote for someone if their position will check off one of their KPIs.</p>
<p>I prioritize the Python community&rsquo;s needs over individual needs.</p>
<p>I prioritize candidates with a track record of getting things done over only showing up to be seen. (Yes, this is a thing.)</p>
<p>I prioritize practical communication skills. If you write over the heads of the community, then you could be more effective at communicating.</p>
<h2 id="im-looking-for-reform">I&rsquo;m looking for reform.</h2>
<p>Overall, I am looking for reform. A few public mishaps by the board have damaged the community&rsquo;s trust in the organization.</p>
<p>I want to see reform across those impacted workgroups, and I will prioritize candidates who show awareness of this. I considered listing them here, but &ldquo;what I&rsquo;m prioritizing&rdquo; when I vote is not up for public debate. I might write more on this later.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-are-running">If you are running</h2>
<p>If you are running for the board, thank you for putting yourself out there.</p>

<p>Before the voting affirmation process was enforced, meeting the 30% quorum mark was an issue.</p>
<p>Last year, over 70% of our members voted, and I suspect we can land somewhere in the middle, letting people continue to vote if they did the previous year and still staying above 50% of our active membership voting.</p>
<p>‚úÖ I support this change.</p>

<p>No one in the Python community is above Python&rsquo;s Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>While I disagree that the board cannot already remove a Fellow, it&rsquo;s better to bring it to the community for a vote.</p>
<p>‚úÖ As a Python Fellow, past board member, and Code of Conduct WG member, I support this change.</p>

			 <p>When I wrote REST APIs, I spent weeks and months writing tests and debugging without looking at the front end. It&rsquo;s all JSON, after all.</p>
<p>For most of my projects, I will open two or three tabs. I&rsquo;m running Docker Compose in tab one to see the logs as I work. I&rsquo;ll use the following <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">casey/just</a> recipe to save some keystrokes and to standardize what running my project looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="color:#75715e"># tab 1</span>
$ just up 
</code></pre></div><p>In my second tab, I&rsquo;ll open a shell that is <strong>inside</strong> my main web or app container so that I can interact with the environment, run migrations, and run tests.</p>
<p>We can nitpick the meaning of &ldquo;console&rdquo; here, but I tend to have another just recipe for &ldquo;shell&rdquo; which will open a Django shell using shell_plus or something more interactive:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="color:#75715e"># tab 2</span>
$ just console
</code></pre></div><p>In my third tab, I&rsquo;ll run a shell session for creating git branches, switching git branches, stashing git changes, and running my linter, which I prefer to run by hand.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="color:#75715e"># tab 3</span>
$ echo <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;I&#39;m boring&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Over the last year or two, the web has returned to doing more frontend work with Django and less with REST. Using <code>ipdb</code>, in my view, to figure out what&rsquo;s going on has been really helpful. Trying to get <code>ipdb</code> to &ldquo;just work&rdquo; takes a few steps in my normal workflow.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># tab 1 (probably)

# start everything
$ just start

# stop our web container
$ just stop web

# start our web container with &quot;--service-ports&quot; 
# just start-web-with-debug
</code></pre><p>The only real magic here is using Docker&rsquo;s <code>--service-ports</code>, which opens ports so we may connect to the open <code>ipdb</code> session when we open one in our view code.</p>
<p>My main <code>justfile</code> for all of these recipes/workflows looks very similar to this:</p>

			 <p>Upgrading Postgres in Docker environments can be daunting, but keeping your database up-to-date is essential for performance, security, and access to new features. While there are numerous guides on manually upgrading Postgres, the process can often be complex and error-prone. Fortunately, the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/pgautoupgrade/pgautoupgrade">pgautoupgrade</a> Docker image simplifies this process, automating the upgrade dance for us.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge-of-upgrading-postgres">The Challenge of Upgrading Postgres</h2>
<p>For many developers, upgrading Postgres involves several manual steps: backing up data, migrating schemas, ensuring compatibility, and testing thoroughly. Mistakes during these steps can lead to downtime or data loss, making the upgrade process a nerve-wracking experience.</p>
<p>The <code>pgautoupgrade</code> Docker image is designed to handle the upgrade process seamlessly. Using it in place of the base Postgres image allows you to automate the upgrade steps, reducing the risk of errors and saving valuable time.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-pgautoupgrade">How to Use pgautoupgrade</h2>
<p>While you can use the <code>pgautoupgrade</code> directly with Docker, I prefer it as my default development image.</p>
<p>I set my <code>compose.yml</code> config with <code>pgautoupgrade</code> similar to this config:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="color:#75715e"># compose.yml</span>

    <span style="color:#f92672">volumes</span>:
      - <span style="color:#ae81ff">postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># ...</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Instead of using the latest version of Postgres, <code>pgautoupgrade</code> can be set to a specific version. This is nice if you want to match whichever version of Postgres you use in production or if you have extensions that might not be ready to move.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="color:#75715e"># compose.yml</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Overall, I&rsquo;m happy with <code>pgautoupgrade</code>. Please note that using <code>pgautoupgrade</code> does not mean you should not make data backups.</p>

			 <p>For a recent client project, we wanted to toggle between various Docker Compose profiles to run the project with or without Celery.</p>
<p>Using Compose&rsquo;s <code>profiles</code> option, we can label services that we may not want to start by default a label. This might look something like this:</p>

<p>Using just&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#environment-variables"><code>env_var_or_default</code></a> feature, we can set both an ENV variable and a default value to fall back on for our project.</p>

			 <p>Last week, my side of the family drove out to Colorado Springs, Colorado, and we rented a house for the week. The trip was great; seeing family was good, and watching the kids spend time with family they don&rsquo;t get to see very often was the highlight for me. The mountains were great, but I don&rsquo;t want to ride a train from 8k to 14k feet of altitude soon.</p>

			 <p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard about <a href="https://blackpythondevs.com">Black Python Devs</a>, Juneteenth is an excellent day to learn about this organization and how to support it.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard about Black Python Devs, here is a quick overview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Black Python Devs was created by its founder Jay Miller after seeing a trend of the same handful of Black developers speaking at major conferences, taking leadership positions, and dealing with the same challenges towards burnout.</p>
<p><a href="https://blackpythondevs.com/about/">blackpythondevs.com/about/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also want to share the goals of Black Python Devs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our goal is to become the largest community of Black Python Developers in the world and establish our community as a source for diverse leaders in the greater Python community.</p>
<p>We aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish guidance, mentorship, and career support for Black Pythonistas around the world.</li>
<li>Create opportunities for the Python community to invest in local communities of Black Python Devs members</li>
<li>Increase participation of Black Python Devs members in existing Python community programs, events, and initiatives.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="follow-them-today">Follow them today</h2>
<p>Juneteenth is also a wonderful day to follow them on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@blackpythondevs">Mastodon</a> (248 followers) or on <a href="https://x.com/blackpythondevs">Xwitter</a> (606 followers).</p>
<p><strong>I would love to check these numbers tomorrow and see a non-zero increase in followers.</strong></p>
<p>You can also financially support Black Python Devs through the GNOME Foundation by scrolling down to the <a href="https://blackpythondevs.com">Support Black Python Devs</a> section of the website.</p>
<h2 id="disclosure">Disclosure</h2>
<p>I am a Black Python Devs Leadership Advisor who has watched and supported this organization grow even before I was asked to join. This team is near and dear to my heart, and I invite you to follow them and help spread the message.</p>

			 <p>This is my first time helping out with <a href="https://djangonaut.space">Djangonaut Space</a> as a Navigator for the <a href="https://djangopackages.org">Django Packages</a> project.</p>
<p>Last week was week zero, making this week one and the first week my team gets to meet as a group.</p>
<p>Coordinating meeting times is always hard when everyone is from a different timezone, and this was no exception. Thankfully, we found a 30-minute block that works for everyone.</p>
<p>Everyone on my team contributed something positive immediately after the meeting invite, including a few project contributions. All in week zero!</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m looking forward to it. I feel under and over-prepared, but I keep getting reassured to take it slow. So, I have some new issues to tag and fill in details before we meet on Wednesday, but we have started, and that&rsquo;s exciting.</p>

			 <p>This week, we learned that <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/">Perplexity AI Is Lying about Their User Agent</a>. I have long suspected that many AI crawlers ignore Robots.txt, which has led me to write a block by User-Agent middleware. This has also led services like <a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a> to start <a href="https://omglol.news/2024/06/16/blocking-bad-bots">Blocking Bad Bots</a> by default.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t even trust that User Agents are respected, so we might need to double down on prompt injections as a possible workaround, since AI services are particularly vulnerable. <a href="https://lewisdale.dev/post/perplexity-ai-is-susceptible-to-prompt-injection/">Perplexity AI is susceptible to prompt injection</a></p>
<p>Ethics be damned; this is another example of tech asking forgiveness, not permission.</p>
<p>Until proven otherwise, AI companies are becoming the bad neighbors of the Internet. They block your driveway, let their dogs poop in our yard without picking it up, use your trashcans without asking, and ask you to get faster Internet after you discover they were still using your guest network after that one time they asked to use it because of an emergency.</p>

			 <p>As part of my recent <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/06/09/enhancing-my-digital.html">Echofeed discovery</a>, I updated my <a href="https://jefftriplett.com/now/">now</a> page to list the most recent video games I&rsquo;m playing and movies and series I&rsquo;m watching. These are all data streams that <a href="https://echofeed.app">Echofeed</a> collects and publishes for me.</p>
<p>Now that I have this data, it inspired me to create stand-alone pages for my <a href="https://jefftriplett.com/games/">games</a>, <a href="https://jefftriplett.com/movies/">movies</a>, and <a href="https://jefftriplett.com/series/">series</a> pages, which I will slowly backfill over time.</p>
<p>This process is 90% automated and 10% of the time, I copy cover images from various sources. When I switch from RSS feeds to a few API calls, I can fully automate this process, but for now, this is fine.</p>
<p>I also created a <a href="https://jefftriplett.com/slashes/">slashes</a> page, which was inspired by the <a href="https://slashpages.net">slash pages</a> project. This page lists all of my existing slash pages and some I plan to make as my website grows. As I build the page, I will start linking back to them.</p>
<p>One example of a slash page is my <a href="https://jefftriplett.com/defaults/">defaults</a> page, which started as one of my first <a href="https://jefftriplett.com/2023/default-apps-2023/">micro.blog posts</a>. As my defaults change over time, I plan to update this new defaults page, and if enough changes, I&rsquo;ll publish my notes and updates via a new micro.blog post.</p>
<p>Overall, I like both of these workflows for my media consumption and my slashes pages. It feels maintainable and gives me an excuse to write more.</p>

			 <p>I dove into <a href="https://echofeed.app">Echofeed</a> this weekend, and I set up three new Echos that consume RSS feeds of various services.</p>
<p>Every time I publish a new blog post on my <a href="https://micro.webology.dev">micro.blog</a>, a new blog post gets published on my <a href="https://jefftriplett.com">main website</a>. My website is currently hosted on GitHub Pages via Jekyll, and Echofeed does the heavy lifting to create a new frontmatter + markdown file for every post.</p>
<p>I also added two more Echos, which consume my <a href="https://trakt.tv/users/jefftriplett">Trakt</a> RSS feeds to track every movie and series I watch into their collections.</p>
<p>I plan to list both data points on my <a href="https://jefftriplett.com/now/">now</a> page, which I always intended to capture what I&rsquo;m currently consuming and doing.</p>
<p>I also use Echofeed to publish these microblog posts to my <a href="https://mastodon.social/@webology">Mastodon account</a>. I prefer this over micro.blog&rsquo;s built-in cross-posting features because Echofeed lets me create a custom post template, which is more flexible. I&rsquo;m using the same workflow for <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/05/31/on-echofeed.html">Django News and Django Packages</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m impressed with Echofeed, and I&rsquo;m happy to pay $25 a year for the value I&rsquo;m getting from it. Please let me know what you think if you try it out and find some value in it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Recently, I have been doing a lot of Django formwork. I start with a basic template like <code>form.as_div</code> or <code>form|crispy</code> until it grows uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Today, I was bouncing between two projects, and I noticed I was working on the tasks that had grown uncomfortable to the point that I dreaded working on the templates.</p>
<p>While I enjoy working with Django&rsquo;s template system, I was putting off these tasks, and all they had in common was finishing some of the form and template work.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t quite understand why this was such a mental blocker, so I stopped working, disconnected, and mowed my yard. Thankfully, that did the trick.</p>
<p>As I finished mowing, I realized that I was struggling to complete these tasks because I was overwhelmed by needing to dump all the form fields into a template.</p>
<p>Once I realized why I was feeling this resistance, I realized I needed to focus on solving this issue to move on.</p>
<p>I remembered Daniel Roy Greenfeld&rsquo;s <a href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/posts/2024-05-rapidly-creating-smoke-tests-for-django-views">Rapidly creating smoke tests for Django views</a> from a few weeks ago, where he made a management command to print out a bunch of smoke tests.</p>
<p>I decided to try the same technique by passing a string path to a Django ModelForm and printing out my form template.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> did not like the templates in templates from my Python script, so I had to swap out the inline example with a gist. Sorry about that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This template could be better, but it was good enough. I tested it on a few of the forms I&rsquo;m using on <a href="https://jobs.django-news.com">Django News Jobs</a>, and it&rsquo;s an improvement over what I started with.</p>
<p>Something was in the water because when I checked our company Slack, Frank Wiles showed me his new <a href="https://github.com/frankwiles/make-management-command">make-management-command</a> project, which takes a similar approach to creating the folders and files needed to create a new management command.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m less concerned despite the fumbled app handoff, I found an open-source Bartender alternative called <a href="https://icemenubar.app">Ice</a> that is worth bringing up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ice is a powerful menu bar management tool. While its primary function is hiding and showing menu bar items, it aims to cover various additional features to make it one of the most versatile menu bar tools available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice">Ice&rsquo;s source code is available on GitHub</a> and is actively developed.</p>
<p>Ice seems like a more than reasonable alternative if you have lost faith in Bartender or are tired of the drama. As a bonus, it&rsquo;s also in <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>.</p>

			 <p>Last week, Google leaked 2,500 pages of internal documentation by accidentally pushing these docs to their GoogleAPI GitHub repo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A collection of 2,500 leaked internal documents from Google filled with details about data the company collects is authentic, the company confirmed today. Until now, Google had refused to comment on the materials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These documents were also leaked Apache 2.0 &ldquo;irrevocable copyright license&rdquo; when released under normal circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fun thing about accidentally publishing to the GoogleAPI GitHub is that, while these are sensitive internal documents, Google technically released them under an Apache 2.0 license. That means anyone who stumbled across the documents was granted a &ldquo;perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license&rdquo; to them, so these are freely available online now, like here.</p>

<p>Several SEO experts have proven that Google has lied to web developers for over a decade. While I don&rsquo;t have any remorse for the SEO industry, knowing &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; is good for anyone who builds a website and wants a chance to reasonably rank.</p>
<p>So, while Google has been called out for years for misleading the general public, now a trove of documents prove it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both Fishkin and King accuse Google of &ldquo;lying&rdquo; to SEO experts in the past. One of the revelations in the documents is that the click-through rate of a search result listing affects its ranking, something Google has denied goes into the results &ldquo;stew&rdquo; on several occasions. The click tracking system is called &ldquo;Navboost,&rdquo; in other words, boosting websites users navigate to. Naturally, a lot of this click data comes from Chrome, even when you leave search. For instance, some results can show a small set of &ldquo;sitemap&rdquo; results below the main listing, and apparently a part of what powers this is the most-popular subpages as determined by Chrome&rsquo;s click tracking.

<p>As a web developer, what&rsquo;s frustrating is how obvious spammy some of the top websites are that mirror websites like <a href="https://www.python.org">python.org</a>&rsquo;s content and add spammy ads and content and somehow outrank the biggest programming language on the planet&rsquo;s docs.</p>
<p>None of this is new. I have seen the same spammy websites for years, which led me to drop Google Search for <a href="kagi.com">Kagi</a> so I could stop seeing them.</p>

<h2 id="family">Family</h2>
<p>This week, I caught whatever flu/bug/virus my family had while I was at PyCon US. It was not fun, and even as of Sunday, I feel weaker than I care to admit or write. I&rsquo;m COVID-negative, but my energy levels have gone from OK to drained.</p>
<p>We are in summer mode, so my son is enrolled in various summer camps. I used to have both kids dropped off by 8 am, and camp starts at 9 am next week. This changes our routine and my working schedule week-by-week.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>We are wrapping up a three-month project, which I hope to have done before we take our family trip in a few weeks. I also have some projects for another client that I need to get worked on. It&rsquo;ll be a busy few weeks.</p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>I reviewed 136 DjangoCon US Opportunity Grants over the weekend.</p>
<p>I worked on some Djangonaut Spaces material for the week. We have a few intro meetings this next week. I have several small projects for which I need to finish creating issues.</p>
<h2 id="side-projects">Side projects</h2>
<p>I transferred a dozen domains from Dynadot to Cloudflare over the weekend. Since not all TLDs are supported yet, I had to leave several domains on Dynadot, but most of my domains are now on Cloudflare, which saves a little bit of money and is easier to manage.</p>
<p>Several projects gained <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/05/31/on-echofeed.html">EchoFeed</a> support, making publishing an RSS/ATOM feed to Mastodon easier.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://django-news.com">Django News Newsletter</a>:</strong> We shipped issue <a href="https://django-news.com/issues/235#start">#235</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://djangopackages.org">Django Packages</a>: Small updates, and I shipped RSS/ATOM feeds for our Changelog.</p>
<p><a href="https://upgradedjango.com">Upgrade Django</a>: We had four updates this week, which is rare.</p>
<p>I wrote a GitHub Issues sync tool that takes the open issues in a repo and saves them locally to markdown + front matter. The tool can also sync changes back.</p>
<p>I wrote a sitemap research tool.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>I swapped out my micro blog&rsquo;s theme for something bigger and easier to read.</p>

<p>For years, I have had several of these on my primary website, but I love having ideas for new ones. I add some of these to various projects I work on, even if they never fully link up. They are like fun easter eggs for anyone who is looking.</p>
<p>Here are a few that I already had pages for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jefftriplett.com/about/">About</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jefftriplett.com/colophon/">Colophon</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jefftriplett.com/now/">Now</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jefftriplett.com/uses/">Uses</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Shortly, I plan to merge my blog and micro.blog together, but these splash pages give me some new ideas for topics to write about and may inspire you, too.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://echofeed.app">EchoFeed</a> is a cheap ($20 to $25 a year) and simple service that takes an RSS, Atom, or JSON feed and posts it to a half dozen services like Mastodon, Micro.blog, Bluesky, and even Discord.</p>
<p>The service also supports GitHub, <a href="https://help.echofeed.app/services/#webmentions">Webmentions</a>, and <a href="https://help.echofeed.app/services/#web-request-webhook">Webhooks</a>, opening up many exciting possibilities.</p>
<p>What makes the service interesting is its support of <a href="https://help.echofeed.app/variables/">variables</a>, making creating a template for your posts possible.</p>
<p>I found this feature helpful for templating job listings for <a href="https://jobs.django-news.com">Django News Jobs</a> updates to include hashtags and for weekly <a href="https://django-news.com">Django News Newsletter</a> release posts.</p>
<p>EchoFeed is a useful service to help wire up static projects and a nice stopgap until more apps support the Fediverse.</p>

			 <p>üè° Today, in this old house&hellip;</p>
<p>I swapped out a first-gen Wyze Floodlight with the latest Floodlight Pro model and adjusted it. Their first-generation floodlight worked great, but we decided to upgrade after some of our neighbors started having random break-ins and random car damage. The latest model&rsquo;s camera has better granularity to read license plates and other details, which is a good peace of mind if there&rsquo;s another hit and run.</p>
<p>Since I already had the ladder out putting up the new floodlight, I removed a limb and many branches that had accumulated on our roof over the winter.</p>
<p>I attempted to recover our garage Orbi satellite, which went offline while in Pittsburgh and refused to reconnect. I chased my tail for a good hour and reset it a few times before giving up. I checked a few hours later, and everything was back in sync.</p>
<p>I recharged our Wyze doorbell camera, which went through a similar loop. It must use lower-power Bluetooth because it only slowly started to charge once I moved the physical doorbell closer to where I was trying to charge it.</p>
<p>I primed our front entryway&rsquo;s rails and support beams, which I had planned on getting to for over a month. I plan to paint it next week.</p>
<p>All on a Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>I have dozens of home maintenance and improvement projects this summer, from gates to stairs to replacing wood rot to painting and staining.</p>

This project includes the bare minimum number of batteries I use in my Django projects.</p>
<p>I also included a justfile, some common recipes, and workflows I use in my personal and client projects. I usually start with these recipes, and then I customize them for the project and the client.</p>
<p>While these batteries and workflows work for me, I think there is something to be said for starting with Django&rsquo;s default <a href="https://github.com/django/django/tree/main/django/conf/project_template">project_template</a> and <a href="https://github.com/django/django/tree/main/django/conf/app_template">app_template</a> to create your own opinionated startproject and startapp templates.</p>

			 <p>Based on a few recommendations, I recently picked up the <a href="https://elliotjaystocks.com/book">Universal Principles of Typography</a> book. The author noticed a few of us talking on Mastodon, which prompted me to write a review on Amazon. They seem nice and here is my review:</p>
<p>tl;dr The book is excellent.¬†</p>
<p>Each of the 100 key concepts has two side pages in a show-and-tell format that leads to the &ldquo;tell.&rdquo;¬†</p>
<p>The first page explains the typography concept in conversational form, making the concept feel approachable and easier to understand. The second page shows practical examples and diagrams showing the concept applied. This format works well.¬†</p>
<p>Each concept stands independently, making picking and choosing what to learn easier without the pressure of understanding everything before advancing.¬†</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Typography¬†or have bought other Typography books and struggled, this is an excellent book to add to your collection.</p>

			 <p>Reading about other people&rsquo;s writing process is fascinating and entertaining. There are no one-size-fits-all life hacks that all writers do other than write and publish. The only correct way to write is to just write.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing what has been working for me. There&rsquo;s no magic in the app, tools, or theme, but I have embraced a bit of new tool energy with <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> and the ease of <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> without the pressure that every post must be a long-form thought piece.</p>
<p>For me, my daily workflow and my  process has been:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a draft using <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>. I prefer the <a href="https://draculatheme.com/obsidian">Dracula theme</a>.</li>
<li>Copy the draft into <a href="https://www.grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> and check for red squiggly lines.</li>
<li>Copy the changes back into Obsidian.</li>
<li>Add the date and update the title.</li>
<li>Copy back into <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>.</li>
<li>Check for red squiggly lines with <a href="https://languagetool.org">LanguageTool</a>.</li>
<li>Update the title and fix the dates.</li>
<li>If anything changes (this is common), I copy everything back into Obsidian.</li>
<li>Publish on Micro.blog.</li>
<li>Back in Obsidian, I move the article from my Drafts folder to my Published folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>I copy and paste a lot. Possibly too much, but Grammarly works better in their app than on the web, and I still find red squiggly lines no matter how much I nitpick, edit, and accept changes. LanguageTool finds things that Grammarly does not and vice versa.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s what works for me.</p>

			 <p>My favorite emulator, <a href="https://www.retroarch.com">RetroArch</a>, is now available on iOS, so I can play my favorite retro console games on my iPhone or iPad.

<p>Setting up RetroArch to handle a wide range of consoles is overwhelming. Thankfully, some good guides like this <a href="https://retrogamecorps.com/2022/02/28/retroarch-starter-guide/">RetroArch Starter Guide</a>.

			 <p>With today&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2024/may/22/django-51-alpha-1-released/">Django 5.1 alpha 1</a> release, picking just one favorite feature is hard. Django 5.1 is scheduled for release this August.</p>
<p>I highly recommend reading the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/5.1/">release notes</a> on everything included in the next release.</p>
<p>Here are a few of my favorite features that are solid quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<h2 id="modeladminlist_display"><code>ModelAdmin.list_display</code></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><code>django.contrib.admin</code></p>
<p><code>ModelAdmin.list_display</code> now supports using <code>__</code> lookups to list fields from related models.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many times a year, I forget that <code>list_display</code> does not support the dunder <code>__</code> lookup, which leads to adding a property on <code>ModelAdmin</code> instead. FINALLY, Django supports this and I&rsquo;m thrilled.</p>
<h2 id="the-querystring-template-tag">The <code>querystring</code> template tag</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><code>{%¬†querystring¬†%}</code>¬†template tag</p>
<p>Django 5.1 introduces the¬†<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/builtins/#std-templatetag-querystring"><code>{%¬†querystring¬†%}</code></a>¬†template tag, simplifying the modification of query parameters in URLs, making it easier to generate links that maintain existing query parameters while adding or changing specific ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of those template tags that I routinely add to my projects because it&rsquo;s so helpful. I&rsquo;m thrilled to no longer need it.</p>
<h2 id="views-require-authentication-by-default">Views require authentication by default</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Middleware to require authentication by default</p>
<p>The new <code>LoginRequiredMiddleware</code> redirects all unauthenticated requests to a login page. Views can allow unauthenticated requests by using the new `login_not_required() decorator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Django now ships with a <code>LoginRequiredMiddleware</code> middleware, which adds authentication to all pages by default.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to see this because &gt;90% of the apps I build require authentication by default, and it&rsquo;d be easier/less code to mark views that do not need required auth. Plus, it feels more secure to have a way to default all views to using auth than to forget to decorate a view that should not be visible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how this impacts using third-party apps with views yet, but I suspect there will be a reasonable solution.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing&hellip;</h2>
<p>There are dozens and dozens of new features in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/5.1/">Django 5.1 release notes</a>. If you spot any gems or have any favorite features, please let me know.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m exhausted after an excellent PyCon US, but I had packing and unpacking on my mind. I usually pack too many clothes in a suitcase that is too small and regretting it on my way back.</p>
<p>I like to use packing cubes, and I still pack way too much into slightly too small of a suitcase, and then I regret it after bringing home too much swap home with me.</p>
<p>This year, I challenged myself to pack less and to bring my more giant suitcase. I could even see the bottom of my luggage around my packing cubes.</p>
<p>Overall, my take-home booth/vendor swag was very modest this year. I only brought home one T-shirt, a hat, and a bunch of stickers. I meant to buy a t-shirt to support <a href="https://blackpythondevs.com">Black Python Devs</a>, but y&rsquo;all bought them all before I could make it back with cash.</p>
<p>I also want to thank my friends who brought gifts for my kids and myself, which I didn&rsquo;t see coming. I am humbled and amazed that my community work and friendship sparked that response. I am humbled, and everything fits perfectly in my suitcase.</p>
<p>My only misses during this trip were bringing too many USB-C cables, one book I never opened, and a smaller satchel to carry my laptop. I even left my computer in my hotel for a few days. Next year, I will bring fewer cables with me.</p>
<p>The only device I wish I had brought was a small power strip. I have a GHome Smart Power Strip, which has a few USB charger ports, and it would have been nicer than fighting some of the hotel&rsquo;s loose, built-in chargers. With a power strip, I would have had more space to plug it into a wall jack.</p>
<p>Someday, I will write up a proper gear post since I picked up a few new items I enjoyed having this year, but tonight, I will start recovering from my sleep debt.</p>

<p>I met someone last night after midnight whom I have known online for over a decade for the first time because my keycard didn&rsquo;t work in the haunted hotel I&rsquo;m staying at. I took this as a sign to say hello to the group of people in the lobby because I was back downstairs anyway. Who am I to argue with ghosts?¬†</p>
<p>My last PyCon US was five years ago, and I don&rsquo;t want to assume we can catch up next year. One pandemic, two virtual conferences, and two family emergencies later, and it took me five years to make it back.¬†So, I no longer take meeting people at conferences for granted because it took five years for me to get back here.¬†¬†</p>
<p>Whether we are old friends, online friends, or haven&rsquo;t met to become friends, I&rsquo;d love to meet today at PyCon US, even if you are shy.</p>

			 <p>I am in Pittsburgh for PyCon US, and three of my last four mornings have begun with a blank iPhone 14 screen that refuses to come back on.</p>
<p>I never charge my phone overnight, so I&rsquo;d like to know if it&rsquo;s the routine change or my Book Book phone case I purchased last week. Either way, waking up to a dead screen after charging all night is stressful.</p>
<p>If you find yourself stuck in this situation, thankfully, there is an Apple <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254226002?answerId=258002087022#258002087022">discussion thread</a> that helped me get to the iPhone logo.</p>

<p>&hellip;press the up volume button once then the down volume once and hold the power button on the right side until you see the Apple logo. This resets the iPhone.</p>

<p>This is apparently a firmware bug, but hopefully, it helps someone who might also wake up to a blank iPhone screen.</p>

			 <p>Here is my PyCon US advice based on Trey Hunner&rsquo;s Mastodon post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are some of your favorite @pycon tips? üí°</p>
<p>Reply and tag #PyConUS. üíñ</p>

<h2 id="talks-are-recorded">Talks are recorded</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that talks are recorded.</p>
<p>Seeing every talk at PyCon US while you are attending is impossible. There are five tracks with three days of talks. There will be times when the two or three talks you most want to attend will all be given during the same block. Or you aren&rsquo;t used to talking to people all day and need extra sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine. The talks are recorded.</p>
<h2 id="ignore-pycon-us-advice-anti-patterns">Ignore PyCon US advice anti-patterns</h2>
<p>Python developers often have firm opinions. Every year, there are several blog posts about why you should &ldquo;only go to talks&rdquo; or &ldquo;only hallway track&rdquo;  when the rest of us will do both.</p>
<h2 id="dont-sleep-on-the-first-two-days-of-the-expo-hall">Don&rsquo;t sleep on the first two days of the Expo Hall</h2>
<p>The Expo Hall has sponsor booths for one reception evening and the first two days of talks. On the third day of talks, the Expo hall gets converted into a Job Fair with other events running, and it takes a lot of work to bump into people.</p>
<p>There have been some years where I never made it out of the Expo Hall for either day, even though I wasn&rsquo;t working a booth. I have even watched lunch get carted in and carted out while talking with people because it&rsquo;s a great location to meet new people and run into everyone you know online or from other conferences over the years. Don&rsquo;t do that. Stop and eat lunch.</p>
<p>Take advantage of the first two days of the Expo Hall, even if you can&rsquo;t make it to the opening reception. Say hi to sponsors, too.</p>
<h2 id="embrace-jomo-joy-of-missing-out">Embrace JOMO (Joy Of Missing Out)</h2>
<p>At my first PyCon US attendance as a board director, I didn&rsquo;t know I was supposed to attend a dinner for PyCon US organizers. My plane arrived late, and I got pinged if I knew about it about 30 minutes after the dinner started. I did a quick check. It was a 20-minute walk in a city I just landed in, so I thanked them and told them I couldn&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>Instead, I went to the hotel bar to get dinner at the bar. I wasn&rsquo;t even staying in the main conference hotel. I made small talk with one of the other patrons, and they were not only attendees, but they just happened to be maintainers of a few of my favorite Python packages.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be amazed at how many people you&rsquo;d otherwise never have met, even when you feel like not saying anything on the beaten path.</p>
<h2 id="remember-burger-kings-golden-rule-have-it-your-way">Remember Burger King&rsquo;s golden rule, &ldquo;have it your way&rdquo;</h2>
<p>My six-year-old loves the Burger King &ldquo;You Rule&rdquo; commercials because of their TV jingle. Even though he&rsquo;s never had their food, that doesn&rsquo;t stop him from singing the ending chorus, &ldquo;At BK, have it your way,&rdquo; and then shouting, &ldquo;(You rule!).&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You rule
You&rsquo;re seizing the day
At BK, have it your way
(You rule!)
<a href="https://genius.com/Burger-king-you-rule-lyrics">genius.com/Burger-ki&hellip;</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I can&rsquo;t speak for their food, it&rsquo;s good advice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You rule</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, everyone likes a compliment and &ldquo;you rule.&rdquo; You probably don&rsquo;t deflect a compliment when a TV jingle gives you one, so carry this into life the next time someone compliments you. Don&rsquo;t deflect it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re seizing the day</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While PyCon US feels like a lot of days, it goes quickly. Take time to enjoy it. I have been to enough PyCons to know that jobs, careers, families, budgets, and health change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At BK, have it your way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only proper way to PyCon US is to &ldquo;have it your way.&rdquo; Go to the talks you want to see and talk to the people you want to talk to, but I encourage you to put yourself out there and meet new people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(You rule!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You rule!</p>
<p>(take the damn compliment)</p>

<p>Two years in a row, in 2022 and 2023, I had to cancel my plans to attend PyCon US at the last minute, which means this is my first year back since 2019.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see old faces, new faces, people¬†who¬†I only know online¬†faces, and everyone who joins my weekly(ish) Office Hours faces.¬†</p>
<p>If you are at PyCon¬†US, please say hi and don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out. I like meeting people matching up social media avatars to their offline bodies.¬†</p>
<p>I arrive Wednesday afternoon, and I have no formal plans on Thursday except to hang out around in the hallway track at the convention center. If I have any downtime, I&rsquo;ll finish this week&rsquo;s Django News Newsletter and work on some random projects, but I&rsquo;m mostly here to meet and chat with people before the opening reception.¬†</p>
<p>Friend, whether or not we have met before IRL, I miss your faces. Come say hi!</p>
<p>Since I haven&rsquo;t seen an official conference Slack/Discord/whatever, my Mastodon is probably the best/easiest way to reach me: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@webology">mastodon.social/@webology</a></p>

			 <p><em>I&rsquo;m calling myself out for this</em> because until about a month ago, <em>I used hashtags all wrong on my social media posts.</em></p>
<p>You can make your posts easier with screen readers with a tiny change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capitalize the first letter of each word in your hashtag</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus some benefits:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Friendlier for screen readers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Friendlier for people with dyslexia or cognitive disabilities</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/make-your-hashtags-accessible">Make Your Hashtags Accessible</a>, which I shared again this morning, and it prompted me to write this up.</p>
<p>Technically, this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case">Pascal&rsquo;s case vs. Camel&rsquo;s case</a>, but either one is better than the lowercase.</p>
<p>As someone with dyslexia, I understand that it&rsquo;s more of a spectrum than a blanket, &lsquo;Jeff is bad with numbers,&rsquo; so it varies. I do find it easier to read something like DjangoConUS vs. djangoconus, which reads like &ldquo;django conus&rdquo; to me instead of &ldquo;django con us.&rdquo; So maybe that is my dyslexic brain, but I suspect it&rsquo;s easier for people who have no clue what a DjangoCon is, either.</p>
<p>One more resource worth reading is <a href="https://scribe.rip/@markwyner/hashtag-accessibility-by-everyone-for-everyone-298667b2d891">Hashtag Accessibility, by Everyone for Everyone</a>, which has a nice tl;dr heading of <em>&ldquo;Just Be Kind: Use Accessible Hashtags.&quot;</em></p>

<h2 id="family">Family</h2>
<p>My youngest was home most of the week with a virus, which changed everything about my week.</p>
<p>We had a rare night out to see <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/05/07/223140.html">Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit at Liberty Hall</a></p>
<p>My family also had a birthday on Friday, my son&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s birthday party on Saturday, and Mother&rsquo;s Day today, so it was a busier than usual week for us and a sick kid all week.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I‚Äôve activated my email vacation autoresponder ahead of PyCon US next week to inform anyone who emails me that I‚Äôm out of the office and when I‚Äôll return. In my autoresponder message, I let everyone know when I will return, an alternative contact in an emergency, and that all incoming emails will be auto-archived or deleted.</p>
<p>This approach ensures I won‚Äôt have an email backlog to work through upon my return. It also sets an upfront expectation for anyone needing something to contact me after I return to the office.</p>
<p>I first got this idea and shared it with colleagues before I left for paternity leave before my son was born. I didn‚Äôt want to email guilt weighing over my head or to be tempted to check my email instead of bonding with my son and being present with my family. I also didn‚Äôt want to spend my first week at work reading old emails and wasting everyone‚Äôs time replying to irrelevant emails.</p>
<p>While researching to see if my idea was absurd, I stumbled upon this <a href="https://qz.com/1061410/arianna-huffington-deletes-every-email-her-employees-receive-while-theyre-on-vacation">Quartz article with advice by Arianna Huffington</a> which validated my idea. I never thought I‚Äôd quote Arianna Huffington, but here we are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe way it works is simple: While you‚Äôre away on vacation, people who email you get a message, letting them know when you‚Äôll be back. And then ‚Äî the most important part ‚Äî the tool deletes the email. If the email is important, the sender can always send it again. If it‚Äôs not, then it‚Äôs not waiting for you when you get back, or, even worse, tempting you to read it while you‚Äôre away. So the key is not just that the tool is creating a wall between you and your email; it‚Äôs that it frees you from the mounting anxiety of having a mounting pile of emails waiting for you on your return ‚Äî the stress of which mitigates the benefits of disconnecting in the first place.‚Äù &ndash; Arianna Huffington</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once I returned, I had a guilt-free, empty inbox. That first week back, I had dozens of congratulatory emails trickling in. I even had several compliments from people who planned on stealing this idea for their future vacations and leaves. This practice worked so well that I used it when my daughter was born and for several trips where I would be gone for a week or more.</p>
<p>Your job and company vary by their policies, so I would discuss this more and double-check who a good alternative contact is while you are gone. If deleting messages is against the company‚Äôs policy, or you aren‚Äôt ready for it, start arching your email so you have it to reference should you need it.</p>

<p>I prefer Nox because it uses Python to write configs, which fits my brain better. I used Tox for over a decade, and there are some tox.ini files that I dread updating because I can only remember how I got here after a few hours of tinkering. That&rsquo;s not Tox&rsquo;s fault. I think that&rsquo;s just a limitation of <code>ini</code> files and the frustration that comes from being unable to use Python when you have a complex matrix to try and sort out.¬†</p>
<p>I recommend trying¬†them out and¬†using¬†the best tool for your brain.¬†There is¬†no¬†wrong¬†path here.</p>

			 <p>We have been under a Tornado Watch since I left work today until about 11 PM tonight. My youngest isn&rsquo;t feeling well, so I&rsquo;m not in the mood for a long post tonight. A Tornado Watch means the conditions are favorable for a Tornado. A Tornado Warning means taking shelter because they have confirmed the spotting of a Tornado.¬†</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, I was stuck downtown for 90 minutes while the sirens were going off because we had a Tornado Warning North of Lawrence, KS, while my family was safe in our basement. Luckily, everyone was safe and sound.</p>

			 <p>Eleven years ago, country music legend Randy Travis lost his voice to a stroke despite keeping 100% of his cognitive skills.¬†Randy used AI to regain his singing voice and released a new single utilizing a mix of AI voice cloning blended with a surrogate voice.</p>
<p>Check out both of these articles for more details: <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/randy-travis-sings-again-courtesy-of-ai-where-that-came-from/">More than a decade after a stroke, Randy Travis sings again, courtesy of AI</a> and <a href="https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/on-the-beauty-and-dilemma-of-the-new-ai-randy-travis-song/">On The Beauty and Dilemma of the New A.I. Randy Travis Song</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is¬†important¬†to note that even though Randy is non-verbal, those close to Travis assure that he is still 100% cognitive, aware, understanding, and even communicative¬†both¬†through simple visual affirmations, as well as¬†writing or typing out things he wishes to communicate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see more unethical and ethical questionable stories about exploitive behavior with AI. It&rsquo;s refreshing to see a story about a living artist literally regaining their voice, which was otherwise lost from a life-altering stroke.</p>

			 <p>My favorite band, Pearl Jam, recently released a new album called Dark Matter, which has led to a series of new interviews.</p>
<p>In the same way, people geeked out over The Beatles: Get Back series, I enjoyed both these videos (despite being YouTube) and seeing behind the scenes of their warehouse/studio/clubhouse. It&rsquo;s a golden era to be a music fan these days.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This week, and especially today, has felt like a grind.¬†</p>
<p>Code ebbs and flows better and worse. Some weeks and days have either been hyperproductive or a suffered a hundred paper cuts to make progress.¬†</p>
<p>Today, I dropped my kids off at their respective schools and hopped into a bi-monthly workgroup meeting as soon as I walked into the office. They needed me to make a quorum, and it&rsquo;s one of those rotating meetings that conflicts with my kid&rsquo;s drop-off schedules every other meeting.¬†</p>
<p>The meeting ended early, and I uploaded grant applications to our conference grant system before I uploaded them again because I forgot to add the extra questions. Two more uploads because of a missing Timestamp field that was a bug. I didn&rsquo;t trust myself, so I uploaded it again.¬†</p>
<p>I went into client-work mode for the next few hours until a friend pinged me, and 20 minutes later, we posted a blog post announcement.¬†</p>
<p>I did more client work and ordered a quick lunch. Over lunch, I had a ping about our conference website, which was ready to go live, but we still needed to discuss the plan to launch it. I renamed one repository, created a new repository, and pushed changes from a third repository with some liberal GitHub Pages changes, and thankfully, everything just worked.¬†</p>
<p>One of my parents had a procedure today, so I got a call from my other parent telling me everything went well. That was a good weight off my shoulders.</p>
<p>I have a weekly writing group meeting on Thursdays that I forgot we weren&rsquo;t meeting today (I think), so I got an extra hour of client work worked in more than my typical Thursday.¬†</p>
<p>Towards the end of the day, we have a weekly company banter/social hour that I joined late for.¬†</p>
<p>It ended early, and a few more conference website issues popped up.¬†</p>
<p>I stayed a little late and came home to see the family, eat dinner, and¬†clean up afterward. The kids' grandfather from Chicago is in town for the weekend.¬†</p>
<p>After dinner, I worked on the newsletter, and every time I thought I was done, I would find one more thing that needed to be done off and on for the next 90 minutes.¬†</p>
<p>I remembered that I had rolled out a new release of the Job website this morning before work, and I thought to double-check it, which made me realize we had two new jobs to post to the newsletter.¬†</p>
<p>I rarely check Slack at night, but I had posted a message about rolling a new feature for one of our more popular libraries, so I merged three pull requests and created a fourth pull request to help clean things up. We&rsquo;ll release it tomorrow.¬†</p>
<p>While checking GitHub notifications, I decided to check another project and realized I had missed a bug report about GitHub Auth needing to be fixed for the last day. I don&rsquo;t know why they call it &ldquo;depend&quot;abot¬†because it&rsquo;s not. One third-party library rollback later, I pin to a previous version, deploy, test, and everything works again.¬†</p>
<p>Tonight, I realized that I still wanted to keep my writing streak up, so here we are.¬†</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of being busy, looking busy, or needing to feel busy, but every day has¬†felt like this.¬†</p>
<p>Thankfully, tomorrow is Friday, and there are only two things on my calendar, including Office Hours, which I look forward to.¬†</p>
<p>We made friends, but it was quite a week.</p>

			 <p>Josh Thomas did a great job documenting and walking us through how he prefers to set up static files in his Django projects last week in his <a href="https://joshthomas.dev/blog/2024/how-i-organize-staticfiles-in-my-django-projects/">How I organize <code>staticfiles</code> in my Django projects</a> article.</p>
<p>Josh recommends the following config and naming convention:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#75715e"># settings.py</span>

<span style="color:#75715e"># django.contrib.staticfiles</span>
STATIC_ROOT <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> BASE_DIR <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;staticfiles&#34;</span>

STATIC_URL <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/static/&#34;</span>

STATICFILES_DIRS <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [
    BASE_DIR <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;static&#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;dist&#34;</span>,
    BASE_DIR <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;static&#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;public&#34;</span>,
]
</code></pre></div><p>Overall, this is very similar to what I do, but I settled into calling my <code>STATICFILES_DIRS</code> folder <code>assets</code> or <code>frontend</code>. After seeing Josh&rsquo;s example, I changed this value to <code>staticfiles</code> to match the setting variable more closely.</p>
<h2 id="updated-config">Updated config</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#75715e"># settings.py</span>

<span style="color:#75715e"># django.contrib.staticfiles</span>

<span style="color:#75715e"># INPUT: Where to look for static files</span>
STATICFILES_DIRS <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [

<span style="color:#75715e"># OUTPUT: Where to put and look for static files to serve</span>

STATIC_URL <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/static/&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This also changes our <code>.gitignore</code> to match our new settings. Since all of our files will be collected by Django and placed into the <code>static</code> folder, we can tell git to ignore this folder.</p>
<p>We can also ignore the <code>staticfiles/dist/</code> folder if we have an asset building pipeline and need a place to store the intermediate files.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>¬†</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>maintained tools to keep thousands of¬†third party¬†packages constantly updated from their¬†open source¬†versions, with patch queues for the ones that needed¬†google-specific¬†changes</li>

<blockquote>
<p>¬†</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>developed and maintained a¬†typechecker¬†(pytype) that would do inference on code without type¬†annotations,¬†and work over¬†very large¬†projects with a one-file-at-a-time architecture (this was my primary job at¬†google, ama)</li>

<p>¬†and¬†that¬†was just the dev portion of our jobs.¬†we¬†also acted as a help desk¬†of sorts¬†for¬†python¬†users at¬†google, helping troubleshoot tricky¬†issues,¬†and point newcomers in the right direction.¬†plus¬†we¬†worked with a lot of other teams, including the machine learning and AI teams, the colaboratory and IDE teams, teams like¬†protobuf¬†that integrated with and generated¬†python¬†bindings, teams like¬†google cloud¬†who wanted to offer¬†python¬†runtimes to their customers, teams like youtube who had¬†an unusually large¬†system built in python and needed to do extraordinary things to keep it performant and maintainable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>¬†</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>¬†and¬†we¬†did all this for years with fewer than 10 people, most of whom loved the work and the team so much that we¬†just¬†stayed on it for years.¬†also, despite the understaffing, we had managers who were extremely good about maintaining work/life balance and the &ldquo;marathon, not sprint&rdquo; approach to work. as¬†i¬†said in another comment, it&rsquo;s the best job¬†i&rsquo;ve¬†ever had, and¬†i&rsquo;ll¬†miss it deeply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have never been more profitable, made more money, or cared less about their employees and giving back to the communities that got them there.¬†If I had worked at Google, I would not have been comfortable continuing to work there.¬†</p>
<p>I plan to keep de-Googling, which is going to hurt. Several friends shared why they can&rsquo;t cut ties with their products. I get it, but that is a sign of an unhealthy monopoly.¬†</p>
<p>I pay for YouTube TV and YouTube Premium as everyone else does, but I&rsquo;m starting with the business tools. I&rsquo;d rather pay Zoom than use Google Video. I stopped using Chrome.¬†</p>
<p>Gmail is the¬†hardest¬†service to separate from because it&rsquo;s also an identity service. I&rsquo;m using it less and less until it&rsquo;s only an identity service. I have &gt;2k websites registered with my Gmail address, which could take years to clean up. I don&rsquo;t need to pay for extra storage space, and I&rsquo;m wondering if Google Docs is doing anything for me to pay for.¬†</p>
<p>So, while it will be harder to stop using Google Products than it should be, the first step is admitting the problem and then working on it. Friends, we all have work to do.</p>

<h2 id="modern-django">Modern Django</h2>
<p>Three or four years ago, our Django stack was optimized to leverage the Django ORM to tie together a mix of authentication and REST API using the Django REST Framework. The front end was entirely buried by JavaScript, which printed HTML into your browser, and the HTML was entirely hidden away. What used to take a developer hours and days now took weeks because there were so many layers and abstractions to wade through.</p>
<p>Then it all started to change a few years ago, and we learned that we don&rsquo;t need the additional weeks of development time to use JS/JSON layers for which we may never build that iOS/Android app. We don&rsquo;t need React for contact us forms, and 90% of our web tasks could be built in a day.</p>
<p>The theme I&rsquo;d like to see more of this year is doing more with HTML instead of hiding it behind layers of JavaScript.</p>
<p>I want to see lots of talks about technologies like HTMx and frameworks like Tailwind CSS, which are firmly centered inside HTML, instead of trying to avoid using HTML.</p>
<h2 id="the-two-non-python-languages-we-are-starting-to-talk-about">The two non-Python languages we are starting to talk about</h2>
<p>Rust and WASM are starting to change everything. How do they fit in with Django and Python?</p>
<h2 id="theme-rust">Theme: Rust</h2>
<p>The Rust language is shaping the landscape of Python productivity in ways that none of us could have predicted. Tools written in Rust are significantly faster and are gaining steam.</p>
<ul>
<li>What can a Django developer take from Rust?</li>
<li>How do I develop a package for Django and Python that uses Rust?</li>
<li>How libraries like PyDantic are speeding up development (Django Ninja uses it)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="always-nice-to-have-talks">Always nice to have talks</h2>
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s new in Django 5.x?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s new in Python 3.13?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s new in Wagtail CMS and Django CMS?</li>
<li>Where do we want the DSF to go?</li>
<li>How to contribute to Django or third party projects</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="embracing-html-and-lightweight-front-end-frameworks">Embracing HTML and lightweight front-end frameworks</h2>
<p>Last year, I predicted it would be the year of &ldquo;you probably don&rsquo;t need JavaScript,&rdquo; and I still feel good about that. We saw <a href="https://htmx.org">HTMx</a> take off, but I think Django is still underserved and could benefit from more talks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Django 5 added more granular template/form styling , and we could use a talk that deep dives</li>
<li>Using Django forms with htmx</li>
<li>Using search with htmx</li>
<li>Whatever cool things you are doing that I didn&rsquo;t mention here</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="panel-ideas">Panel ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Django Fellows panel</li>
<li>Django content creators' panel</li>

<h2 id="talks-i-dont-want-to-see">Talks I don&rsquo;t want to see</h2>
<p>I find myself at a weird crossroads because I have never discouraged certain topics, but we need to talk more openly about what is bad for our industry and the world instead of avoiding it. Otherwise, we are left with dead air, and people assume we are all on the same page.</p>
<p>To kick us off, there are talks and topics that I do not want to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>BAD AI talks and ones that spread more FUD into the community</li>
<li>crypto talks</li>
<li>why technology sucks</li>
<li>proposing a talk because you dislike or even hate something</li>
<li>bashing other communities</li>
<li>bashing our communities</li>
<li>lightning talks disguised as questions (not so much a talk idea, but this has been on my mind for a while)</li>
</ul>
<p>So please, <strong>none</strong> of these:</p>

		<a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/04/27/drop-google-chrome-and-try/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-04-27 09:33:47 -0500">Apr 27, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last year, I switched to the <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> web browser because I read a few peer reviews that pointed out that Vivaldi is a better Google Chrome web browser than Chrome.</p>
<p>This week, Vivaldi rolled out a <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/desktop/tabs/memory-saver/">new memory-saver feature</a> that I&rsquo;m excited to try out. It lets <em>you</em> decide how long to keep a tab in memory before hibernating and reclaiming the memory dedicated to the tab.</p>
<p>Vivaldi&rsquo;s memory and CPU usage are already night and day better than Google Chrome. For instance, I can have one Chrome window with three tabs open ironically for Google Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Docs, which eat up more resources than 2 to 4 Vivaldi windows open with countless tabs.</p>
<p>As it turns out, all that tracking and spyware eats up a ton of RAM and CPU. Who knew? ü§∑</p>
<p>All of my Chrome Extensions work on Vivaldi using the Chrome Store except for my custom Django News &ldquo;newtab&rdquo; extension that I wrote. I suspect it&rsquo;s me, and I probably need 15 minutes to troubleshoot it.</p>
<p>Instead, I&rsquo;m nudging you to drop Google Chrome and try out <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> because several of my Google friends were fired this week despite <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/04/25/google-soars-toward-record-2-trillion-valuation-on-earnings/?sh=536f86313c4d">the company never being more profitable</a>.</p>
<p>ChatGPT told me that Alphabet/Google are worth enough to give everyone on Earth $253.16, which feels like a fair tradeoff. I&rsquo;d like mine to be a check because I do not trust Google with my bank details, nor should you.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-dont-like-about-vivaldi">What I don&rsquo;t like about Vivaldi</h2>
<p>Vivaldi is outstanding and could be better.</p>
<p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll want to do is access the &ldquo;Settings &raquo; Address Bar &raquo; Drop-Down Menu Priority&rdquo; and uncheck the &ldquo;Direct Match&rdquo; option.</p>
<p>The Direct Match option tends to match from &ldquo;Brand websites,&rdquo; which is one of the ways Vivaldi makes money, but it&rsquo;s not the only way. When Direct Match is checked, I get recommendations for Macy&rsquo;s instead of Mastodon until I discovered how to turn it off.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/vivaldi-business-model/">What&rsquo;s Vivaldi&rsquo;s business model?</a> to better understand how they work.</p>
<p>I would love to see Vivaldi let me PAY THEM MONEY annually for a solid web browser that aligns with my interests. Until then, I&rsquo;m OK with them getting an affiliate cut from eBay or Amazon when I use their bookmarks.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-firefox">Why not Firefox?</h2>
<p>I hear this often, and I won&rsquo;t talk anyone down from their favorite browser unless it&rsquo;s Chrome or whatever Microsoft calls their latest hobby browser this decade. ü§∑</p>
<p>Firefox doesn&rsquo;t work well for me, and I say this because I have used it for over a decade. I also don&rsquo;t trust their parent company because of where their money comes from and the various mistakes they <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/mozilla-drops-onerep-after-ceo-admits-to-running-people-search-networks/">continue to make</a>.</p>
<p>If Firefox sparks joy, I encourage you to use it. I continue to get &ldquo;the emperor has no clothes&rdquo; vibes from their company, even when I want to like their products.</p>
<h2 id="share-your-thoughts">Share your thoughts</h2>
<p>If you have thoughts, I&rsquo;m on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@webology/112343674364725570">Mastodon</a>, and I&rsquo;d love to know what config options worked best for you.</p>

			 <p>At night, when I&rsquo;m couch computing after everyone goes to bed, I use one of these XL adjustable lap desks with my MacBook Pro (2019 model) and a cheap, wired external mouse that I love using. <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0B4F96VCD">camelcamelcamel.com/product/B&hellip;</a> This desk is wonderful, and I highly recommend it. üòò</p>
<p>However, while it&rsquo;s the perfect height/location for typing, the built-in trackpad is more problematic to use to the point I don&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>So, with these factors in mind, I&rsquo;d like to know if anyone has an external Trackball they want that would pair well with this setup. I&rsquo;m open to all suggestions and eager to hear your experiences.¬†</p>
<p>Historically, I have had fantastic luck with Logitech keyboards and various products over the years, but I&rsquo;m a little put off by their recent &ldquo;Put an AI on It&rdquo; trend. So I&rsquo;m not against it, but I&rsquo;m not excited about it.¬†</p>
<p>Do you have any recommendations¬†for a good¬†trackball that&rsquo;s not Apple&rsquo;s Magic Trackpad?</p>

			 <p>My first PC as a kid ran MS-DOS 4, so seeing today&rsquo;s news on <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/open-sourcing-dos-4">Open Sourcing DOS 4</a> takes me back.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, in partnership with IBM and in the spirit of open innovation, we&rsquo;re releasing the source code to MS-DOS 4.00 under the MIT license. There&rsquo;s a somewhat complex and fascinating history behind the 4.0 versions of DOS, as Microsoft partnered with IBM for portions of the code but also created a branch of DOS called Multitasking DOS that did not see a wide release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I played with LOGO and Applesoft BASIC on my grade school&rsquo;s Apple IIe, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC">GW-BASIC</a> shipped with MS-DOS 4 and was the first programming language that I knew inside and out.</p>
<p>I struggled at times because book and magazine examples were written for BASICA, which mostly worked, but it sometimes took some extra fiddling.</p>
<p>MS-DOS 5.0 exposed me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic</a>, which was the first programming language I worked with that had an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a>.</p>
<p>I fondly remember writing code on that old 386 and playing DOS games. I remember thinking there would eventually be no limits between the code and what I saw was possible on Star Trek: The Next Generation just a few years later.</p>
<p>Looking back, we aren&rsquo;t there yet, but we are closer to the Star Trek computer and Holodeck than to the technology I grew up in.</p>

			 <p>If you use GitHub Actions to build and deploy Docker container images, you quickly learn that deleting old container images you no longer need is a huge pain. I don&rsquo;t know why GitHub doesn&rsquo;t make this easier, but they have a reusable workflow we can use to help prune and clean up old container images.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/actions/delete-package-versions">delete-package-versions</a> will let you set a number to only keep the last x-known good images, with some other valuable options like deleting untagged container images.</p>
<p>I prefer to write one <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows">reusable workflow</a>, which I can call from my standard CI build and deploy pipeline, along with a workflow_dispatch action we can call whenever we want.</p>
<p>This workflow is a mouthful but wraps the <code>delete-package-versions</code> action and gives us a few configurable options to pass. Having a default value on <code>min_versions_to_keep</code> is nice because it is a default when calling this workflow from other locations.</p>

			 <p>The Nintendo Switch is very popular in my household. My six-year-old is at the right age to play a round or two of Mario Kart, TMNT, Kirby, or whatever we feel like, and it&rsquo;s a fun night. What gets annoying is taking the Switch out from under our TV to switch games and wait for it to reconnect to the TV.</p>
<p>I was sharing this &ldquo;pain&rdquo; with a friend of mine who shared this <a href="https://www.unitek-products.com/products/4-in-1-game-card-reader">Unitek 4-in-1 Game Card Reader</a> (similar model) with me, which might be the most lazy product that I own. The Unitek reader connects to your Switch and holds four games, which you can switch between with a remote button. The product has no frills, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to. All it needs to do is switch games when you press a button, which it does wonderfully.</p>
<p>Oh, a whim, I decided to check out their website to see what other products they make, and I stumbled on their <a href="https://www.unitek-products.com/products/game-kvm-docking-station-with-remote">Game KVM Docking Station with Remote</a>. If I needed a Dock, I would be tempted. TBH, I&rsquo;m already tempted to know if I could stack my 4-in-1 Game Card reader with the KVM Docking station to get seven games on standby, but I suspect the remotes will be on the same frequency.</p>
<p>If video game emulation is your thing, I picked up <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">Delta</a> last week for iOS in the App Store, but  I have yet to have time to try it out. I own several small portable emulation devices that I rarely use, but Delta might be the one that finally sticks because I always have my iPhone with me.</p>

<p>To use this code in production, I would normalize the <code>user_agent</code> and <code>BLOCKED_USER_AGENTS</code> variables to be case-insensitive.</p>
<p>I would also consider storing my list of user agents in a Django model or using a project like <a href="https://github.com/jazzband/django-robots">django-robots</a> instead of a hard-coded Python list.</p>

			 <p>I spent a lot of time in my shell (terminal, iTerm, bash, whatever you prefer), and by and large, my least favorite and most frustrating chore has always been trying to customize my shell prompt.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I tried to switch from BASH to Zsh and even the Fish Shell, and I quickly reverted because I found customizing my prompt to be such a chore.</p>
<p><a href="https://starship.rs">Starship</a> is one of those few life-changing development utilities that quickly solved how to customize my shell prompt. Starship also works across various shells, which means changing shells doesn&rsquo;t mean starting over with a new prompt. Even though Fish and Zsh never stuck for me, Starship was a keeper.</p>
<p>Starship&rsquo;s default prompt is really good and is a nicer starting point than Zsh or BASH gives you by default. Starship includes a bunch of default settings, which enables support for tools like aws, battery percentage, bun, git, k8s, node js, python, etc, so most of <a href="https://github.com/jefftriplett/dotfiles/blob/main/home/.config/starship.toml">my dotfiles config</a> is turning off the features that I don&rsquo;t care about.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://draculatheme.com/starship">Dracula Theme for Starship</a>, which is my go-to theme for any application that I can find that supports the color scheme.</p>
<p>Setting up and configuring Starship is a breeze. The documentation is clear and concise, and Starship&rsquo;s settings are neatly organized in one readable and updated file, <code>~/.config/starship.toml</code>. Best of all, any changes you make are immediately applied, eliminating the need to restart your shell session. With Starship, you can confidently customize your prompt and see the results instantly.</p>
<p>If you use Homebrew, <code>brew install starship</code> will install it. You can activate Starship by adding <code>eval &quot;$(starship init bash)&quot;</code> to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file.</p>
<p>If you have been thinking about trying out Starship or need help figuring out where to start or how to customize your shell prompt, I highly recommend it.</p>

			 <p>Last year, I wrote this <a href="https://jefftriplett.com/2023/rustywind-pre-commit-hook/">TIL: Creating a Rustywind pre-commit hook</a>, which illustrates how to use the <a href="https://github.com/avencera/rustywind">Rustywind</a> CLI, which helps organize <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a> classes.</p>
<p>Rustywind is a CSS class linting and formatting CLI tool that helps sort Tailwind CSS classes consistently and can help to de-duplicate them. If you struggle with duplicate classes or feel overwhelmed, Rustywind might be what you need.</p>
<p>I prefer to install Rustywind as a <a href="https://pre-commit.com">pre-commit</a> hook to run on every git commit or when I run <code>pre-commit run</code>.</p>
<p>This <code>.pre-commit-config.yaml</code> config will run the latest version of Rustywind every time pre-commit runs.</p>

<p>The mowing season has officially kicked off. I mowed our yard for the first time this year on the highest setting because our grass seemed to have grown a foot in a week in several places since I fertilized it last weekend. I also trimmed and removed leaves and branches from the yard. I was rewarded by a late afternoon migraine, but lucked out and only lasted for a few hours.</p>
<p>I finally broke out my miter saw and portable workbench and made room for it in the garage. As I fixed one of the beams that held up the front porch, I realized the water damage was much worse than I thought. It was only held up by one beam, so I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t put off fixing it any longer. The new support is now fixed, primed, and ready for some wood filler in the holes with a fresh coat of paint to be applied.</p>
<p>My son was an excellent helper this weekend, spending most of Sunday following me around and helping. We also went to a Lawrence fixture Cotton&rsquo;s Hardware store to get some grass seed, windshield wiper fluid, and a replacement garden hose.</p>

			 <p>Dear Tech Companies,</p>
<p>There is never a good time to interrupt a two-year-old to ask her for a one to five-star review while she&rsquo;s playing the LEGO¬Æ DUPLO¬Æ WORLD game.</p>
<p>I understand that app review ratings are a vital metric impacting your rank in App Stores. While it pains me to write this, if your app is good and my children like it, we parents will rate it on our own time instead of being forced to so our children can return to their firetruck game because an App Store review popup prevents them from playing. I assume no one on the LEGO app store team has children to understand the pain, confusion, and agony this brings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s deeply frustrating to encounter in-game purchases in a game designed for TWO TO FIVE-YEAR-OLDS. Fortunately, we&rsquo;re on the Apple One / Apple Arcade plan, which allows us to bypass such unnecessary features.</p>
<p>I hope that you can learn from the mistakes made in the LEGO¬Æ DUPLO¬Æ WORLD game. This way, you can avoid frustrated parents leaving you with low app store ratings in the heat of the moment.</p>

<p>Weekend <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/django">#django</a> question/poll</p>
<p>How often do you use <code>startproject</code> &amp; <code>startapp</code> or something else?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These commands vary by the client or project I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>I use <code>startproject</code> one to two times a month.</p>
<p>I use <code>startapp</code> one to a dozen times a week.</p>
<p>I have used <a href="https://github.com/copier-org/copier">copier</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter">cookiecutter</a>, and both have their place, but I only use them occasionally.</p>
<p>I create more new projects and apps than the average developer because I&rsquo;m curious and spin up projects quickly to try out ideas. I prefer this over every experiment being part of a mono project because I will throw most of these away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and how many years since you started using django?</p>

<p>I have been using Django since 2006.</p>

			 <p>A friend asked me which bookmarking service I switched to after I moved on from the Pinboard bookmark service.</p>
<p>tl;dr I use <a href="https://raindrop.io">Raindrop</a>. The product and API works wonderfully. üëç</p>
<p>A good bookmark service should:</p>
<ul>
<li>be easy to add a bookmark</li>
<li>have a good browser extension or have a good bookmarklet</li>
<li>be the best personal search engine</li>
<li>be a good research tool for taking notes and allowing tagging</li>
<li>be reliable</li>
<li>maintain reasonable uptime</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, I realized I had been on Raindrop&rsquo;s FREE plan for over a year, so I fixed that and upgraded to a PRO account.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good sign since I have ~40k and over two decades of bookmarks, and they never pressured me to upgrade or put limits on my account in any frustrating way.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-gave-up-on-pinboard">Why I gave up on Pinboard</h2>
<p>I could write thousands of words about how frustrating being a paid user was, but I&rsquo;ll sum it up as running Pinboard wasn&rsquo;t a priority for Pinboard&rsquo;s founder, and it painfully showed. üëé</p>

			 <p>I have noticed a GitHub bug for a few weeks, but I kept forgetting to ask publicly about it.</p>
<p>Today, I noticed it again, and I tracked it down to README.rst files, so I wrote this post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has anyone else noticed that some READMEs on GitHub have been broken recently?</p>
<p>I thought it was just me, but the pattern seems to be like code blocks in rst files no longer get formatted.</p>

<p>This led to several friends chiming in and one link to this <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/113792">open GitHub issue</a> thanks to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@FunkyBob@chaos.social/112249599598006182">Funky Bob</a></p>
<p>The story&rsquo;s moral is that writing software is hard; even GitHub makes mistakes and breaks things.</p>
<p>If a trillion-dollar tech company can break things for weeks, cut yourself some slack the next time you stumble on a production.</p>

			 <p>If you are like me and have a habit of opening links in new tabs for days, weeks, and sometimes months, then you probably have not discovered the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/copy-all-urls/djdmadneanknadilpjiknlnanaolmbfk">Copy tabs URL</a> browser extension.</p>
<p>The <em>Copy tabs URL</em> browser extension is a lifesaver for those who habitually open links in new tabs. It effortlessly copies all open tabs from a browser window into your clipboard, eliminating the need for manual copying and pasting. This makes it a breeze to paste into your editor of choice, such as <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>, saving you valuable time and effort.</p>
<p>With the <em>Copy tabs URL</em> browser extension, I can easily copy all of my open tabs into a markdown document. This simple action helps me overcome mental hurdles, as I know that the link is safely filed away where I can search and find it later. This makes closing the tab a much easier decision for me.</p>
<p>For longer-term storage, I use the <a href="https://raindrop.io">Raindrop</a> bookmark manager to track links I want to find later because it doubles as an excellent research tool and personal search engine. Before Raindrop, I frustratingly used Pinboard for a decade.</p>
<p>So, while the <em>Copy tabs URL</em> browser extension works with Chrome, I switched to the <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> browser last year, and it works just fine.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a> is one of my daily drivers, and here are my notes for reclaiming disk space and a bonus tip for getting a faster runtime.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="docker-containers-prune">Docker &ldquo;Containers&rdquo; Prune</h2>
<p>Most of the time, when I run into a Docker issue, it&rsquo;s because I have out of disk space allocated for Docker containers and images.</p>
<p>90% of the time, you can reclaim the most disk space by running <code>docker system prune</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> Docker&rsquo;s default behavior is to remove &ldquo;stopped containers,&rdquo; which are instances of containers that have already run and are no longer valid. There is no good reason to keep these around, so <strong>I consider this a safe operation</strong> to run.</p>

WARNING! This will remove:
  - all stopped containers
  - all networks not used by at least one container

<h2 id="docker-build-cache-prune">Docker &ldquo;Build Cache&rdquo; Prune</h2>
<p>Docker&rsquo;s Build Cache stores or caches all of the various build steps that Docker will use to assemble an image.</p>

<p><strong>I do not recommend bulk deleting all of your volumes.</strong></p>
<p>Unless you really, really mean it, and you know what you are doing, leave <code>docker volume prune</code> alone.</p>

<p>I skipped last week&rsquo;s update because we spent Easter weekend with my family and ~6 hours in the car with the kids.</p>
<p>We went to our favorite local nursery, <a href="https://vinlandvalleynursery.com">Vinland Valley Nursery</a>, to pick up some new Hostas and other heartier plants since April is still a bit early for planting flowers because we typically have a few late freezes through Spring. We planted everything, and I fertilized the lawn to prepare it for the season.</p>
<p>I unboxed and assembled my portable workbench and miter saw. My miter saw shipped with everything but the manual, and by the time I found one and printed it, it was time for me to make dinner. I cooked burgers on the outdoor griddle for the first time this year.</p>

<p>Even though March is over, March Madness continues, and I enjoyed two more weekends of Men&rsquo;s and Women&rsquo;s basketball. I took first place in my women&rsquo;s bracket this week. My son tied for #2 and was excited about it tonight.</p>
<p>While I am in first place for my men&rsquo;s bracket, they play tomorrow (Monday), and the team I picked to win lost last weekend. So I will only win this year if there is a team fight and both teams forfeit. So there is still a chance.</p>

<p>I should have mowed today and made another pass at removing sticks and leaves accumulated over the Spring. So I suspect we&rsquo;ll spend some time outside doing that next week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also time to break out the miter finally saw and spend half a day replacing old boards, repairing fences, and getting my money&rsquo;s worth out of it.</p>

			 <p>One of Django&rsquo;s most powerful features is the ORM, which includes a robust migration framework. One of Django&rsquo;s most misunderstood features is Django migrations because it just works 99% of the time.</p>
<p>Even when working solo, Django migrations are highly reliable, working 99.9% of the time and offering better uptime than most web services you may have used last week.</p>
<p>The most common stumbling block for developers of all skill levels is rolling back a Django migration and prepping a pull request for review.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not picky about pull requests or git commit history because I default to using the &ldquo;Squash and merge&rdquo; feature to turn all pull request commits into one merge commit. The merge commit tells me when, what, and why something changed if I need extra context.</p>
<p>I am pickier about seeing &gt;2 database migrations for any app unless a data migration is involved. It&rsquo;s common to see 4 to 20 migrations when someone works on a database feature for a week. Most of the changes tend to be fiddly, where someone adds a field, renames the field, renames it again, and then starts using it, which prompts another <code>null=True</code> change followed by a <code>blank=True</code> migration.</p>
<p>For small databases, none of this matters.</p>
<p>For a database with 10s or 100s of millions of records, these small changes can cause minutes of downtime <em>per</em> migration, which amounts to a throwaway change. While there are ways to mitigate most migration downtime situations, that&rsquo;s different from my point today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also guilty of being fiddly with my Django model changes because I know I can delete and refactor them before requesting approval. The process I use is probably worth sharing because once every new client comes up.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume I am working on <a href="https://jobs.django-news.com">Django News Jobs</a>, and I am looking over my pull request one last time before I ask someone to review it. That&rsquo;s when I noticed four migrations that could quickly be rebuilt into one, starting with my <code>0020*</code> migration in my <code>jobs</code> app.</p>
<p>The rough steps that I would do are:</p>

<p>Occasionally, I check out another branch with conflicting migrations, and I&rsquo;ll get my <strong>local</strong> database in a weird state.</p>
<p>In those cases, check out the <code>--fake</code> (&ldquo;Mark migrations as run without actually running them.&quot;) and <code>--prune</code> (&ldquo;Delete nonexistent migrations from the <code>django_migrations</code> table.&quot;) options. The fake and prune operations saved me several times when my <code>django_migrations</code> table was out of sync, and I knew that SQL tables were already altered.</p>
<h2 id="what-not-squashmigrations">What not <code>squashmigrations</code>?</h2>
<p>Excellent question. <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/migrations/#migration-squashing">Squashing migrations</a> is wonderful if you care about keeping every or most of the operations each migration is doing. Most of the time, I do not, so I overlook it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The <a href="https://github.com/jazzband/django-waffle">django-waffle</a> feature flag library is helpful for projects where we want to release and test new features in production and have a controlled rollout. I also like using feature flags for resource-intensive features on a website that we want to toggle off during high-traffic periods. It&rsquo;s a nice escape hatch to fall back on if we need to turn off a feature and roll out a fix without taking down your website.</p>
<p>While Waffle is a powerful tool, I understand the challenge of keeping track of feature flags in both code and the database. It&rsquo;s a pain point that many of us have experienced.</p>
<p>Waffle has a <code>WAFFLE_CREATE_MISSING_FLAGS=True</code> setting that we can use to tell Waffle to create any missing flags in the database should it find one. While this helps discover which flags our application is using, we need to figure out how to clean up old flags in the long term.</p>
<p>The pattern I landed on combines storing all our known feature flags and a note about what they do in our main settings file.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>We can use the <code>WAFFLE_CREATE_MISSING_FLAGS</code> settings as a failsafe to create any flags we might have accidently missed. They will stick out because they will not have a note associated with them.</p>
<p>This pattern is also helpful in solving similar problems for scheduled tasks, which might also store their schedules in the database.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://upgradedjango.com">Upgrade Django</a> is a <a href="https://www.revsys.com">REVSYS</a> project we created six years ago and launched three years ago.</p>
<p>The goal of Upgrade Django was to create a resource that made it easy to see at a glance which versions of the <a href="djangoproject.com">Django web framework</a> are maintained and supported. We also wanted to catalog every release and common gotchas and link to helpful information like release notes, blog posts, and the tagged git branch on GitHub.</p>
<p>We also wanted to make it easier to tell how long a given version of <a href="https://upgradedjango.com/4.2/">Django would be supported</a> and what <a href="https://upgradedjango.com/4.1/">phase of its release cycle</a> it is in.</p>
<h2 id="future-features">Future features</h2>
<p>We have over a dozen features planned, but it&rsquo;s a project that primarily serves its original purpose.</p>
<p>One feature on my list is that I&rsquo;d love to see every backward incompatible change between two Django versions. This way, if someone knows their website is running on <a href="https://upgradedjango.com/3.2/">Django 3.2</a>, they could pick <a href="https://upgradedjango.com/4.2/">Django 4.2</a> or <a href="https://upgradedjango.com/5.0/">Django 5.0</a> version and get a comprehensive list with links to everything they need to upgrade between versions.</p>
<p>Projects like Upgrade Django are fun to work on because once you collect a bunch of data and start working with it, new ways of comparing and presenting the information become more apparent.</p>
<p>If you have ideas for improving Upgrade Django that would be useful to your needs, we&rsquo;d love to hear about them.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A month or two ago, I stumbled on <a href="https://github.com/epogrebnyak/justpath"><code>justpath</code></a>, which is worth installing to help clean up any PATH environment issues you may or may not realize you have.</p>
<p>I was frustrated because every time I created a new tab in iTerm2, it took three or more seconds for whatever slowed everything in my bash/dotfiles.</p>
<p>With <code>justpath</code>, I found it straightforward to identify and address several paths related to ruby, rbenv, cargo, golang, and others that were causing issues. Rather than continue to fight these apps, I deleted them and removed them from my <code>.bash*</code> files. To see if I broke anything, I opened a new iTerm tab, and I had a new shell prompt in less than a second.</p>
<p>Since I needed access to Ruby, NPM, and other tools, I  switched over to <a href="https://github.com/jdx/mise"><code>mise</code></a>, which promises to be one tool for managing these languages and tools. <code>mise</code> is also written in Rust, so I know it&rsquo;s fast by default.</p>
<p>To get started, check out Mise&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/jdx/mise?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart">Quickstart</a> docs in their README. I modified their bash example and added it to my <code>.bash*</code> files.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> command -v mise &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; <span style="color:#66d9ef">then</span>

<span style="color:#66d9ef">fi</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Once Mise was set up, and I opened a new tab, I installed Go, Node.js, Ruby, and Rust:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="color:#75715e"># to install Go</span>
mise install golang

<span style="color:#75715e"># to install Node.js</span>
mise install node

<span style="color:#75715e"># to install Ruby</span>
mise install ruby

<span style="color:#75715e"># to install Rust</span>
mise install rust

<span style="color:#75715e"># to reshim/add these tool to our path...</span>
mise reshim
</code></pre></div><p>Eventually, I used Mise to install kubectl (boo) and yarn (hiss). Here is a list of everything on my older MacBook Pro that Mise is managing for me.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ mise list

ruby     3.3.0
rust     1.77.1
yarn     1.22.19
</code></pre></div><p>Another nice feature of Mise is that you can list the versions of each tool that you want Mise to install and manage for you in a <code>.tool-versions</code> file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ cat ~/.tool-versions
<span style="color:#75715e"># direnv latest</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># golang latest</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># kubectl 1.22.2</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># nodejs 18.9.1</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># nodejs lts</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># ruby 3.1.2</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># starship latest</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># yarn 1.22.19</span>
nodejs 20.10.0
</code></pre></div><p>As a nice bonus, I discovered I could use Mise to manage the <code>direnv</code> and <code>starship</code> tools. In theory, Mise can also replace <code>direnv</code> with their built-in <a href="https://mise.jdx.dev/environments.html">environment</a> support), but I haven&rsquo;t tried that feature yet.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Mise is a nice win. I cut my new iTerm2 tab/session time down to close to 1/4 of a second, and I have more granular control over which exact versions of each tool I&rsquo;m using.</p>
<p>Overall, I still prefer to use <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv"><code>pyenv</code></a> to manage my Python versions, so I&rsquo;m keeping that for now mainly because I use <code>pyenv-virtualenvwrapper</code> and a few other nice-to-haves. See my <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/02/10/python-development-on.html">Python Development on macOS Notes: pyenv and pyenv-virtualenvwrapper</a> article on why and how I manage those.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m happy that OpenSSF updated their blog post to remove all mentions of their scorecards, they forgot to mention why, apologize, or publicly acknowledge that they messed up.</p>
<p>Since they rushed their first blog post and spent so little time on it, I wanted to point out the changes and equally spend very little time on why their scorecard is actively harmful to projects that handle security well.</p>
<p>Today was a rare day off for me, and documenting the numerous red flags of OpenSSF&rsquo;s Scorecards isn&rsquo;t how I spent my Monday night, nor will I spend my Tuesday or any night on this.</p>
<p>Instead, check out the Scorecards for these three popular projects.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> scores a 6.9</li>
<li><a href="https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/python/cpython">cpython</a> scores a 7.0</li>
<li><a href="https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/django/django">Django</a> scores a 7.2</li>
</ul>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t sure where to start, compare the &ldquo;Pinned-Dependencies&rdquo; and &ldquo;Best-Practices&rdquo; over the three projects. Then, look at the reference files and see if you agree.</p>

			 <p>Sixty days ago, I started blogging daily with my <a href="https://wiggle.work">Wiggle Work</a> friends. Our goal was to blog every day in February, and I&rsquo;m happy to report that <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/03/01/we-did-it.html">all five of us</a> did.</p>
<p>When March rolled around, I had a dozen+ drafts that I never fully fleshed out, so I decided to keep going. I have over two dozen drafts in various states that I never published. I feel good about having plenty of content and ideas to keep writing. I don&rsquo;t know what April will be like, but I feel comfortable about where I&rsquo;m going.</p>
<p>Truthfully, the second month was much easier than the first, and there was no pressure to continue or not <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/03/30/xz-update-dont.html">say what I want to say</a> about something.</p>
<p>Friends, I encourage you to write and publish more on your blog. If you struggle with editing (I sure as hell do), copy and paste your work into Grammarly or LanguageTool to minimally edit and publish them. That process has been good enough for me. You don&rsquo;t have to write daily, but I encourage you to publish more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A malicious or compromised maintainer is extremely difficult to guard against using automated tools or supply chain security technologies. Looking back at the last OpenSSF Scorecard report on the xz repository, we do see a number of best practices such as Code-Review, Token-Permissions, Branch-Protection, and Static-Analysis were not enabled, nor did xz have the OpenSSF Best Practices badge. It&rsquo;s difficult to predict whether these settings on their own would have prevented this backdoor, however, security best practices were not followed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OpenSSF&rsquo;s Scorecard shows that the Django project is barely rated higher than xz. Django is a good test of the quality of rating systems and scorecards. When Django ranks poorly or average, you are measuring the wrong things.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a mistake that only OpenSSF makes. I have seen a half dozen other services ding them for things like not having a Code of Conduct and then linking two or three examples that attribute Django&rsquo;s Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Pointing out that someone who is already burned out and never knew your best practices existed is a bad PR move.</p>
<p>Even worse, we are now paying attention to your best practices, which don&rsquo;t hold water.</p>
<p>Even worse, if you aren&rsquo;t proactively offering funding to these solo projects you knew were destined to fail, you are actively part of the problem and trying to profit from it. Please stop making it worse for the next burned-out maintainer.</p>
<p>Also, project maintainers hate being opted into things they have yet to ask or sign up for.</p>
<p>Do better OpenSSF.</p>

			 <p>According to ChatGPT, the 3-2-1 backup rule is a simple yet effective strategy for ensuring data safety in case of a loss or disaster. Here&rsquo;s what it stands for:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>3 copies of your data:</strong>  Maintain three copies: the original and two backups.</li>
<li><strong>2 different media:</strong> Store the backups on two distinct media types or platforms.</li>
<li><strong>1 off-site backup:</strong> Keep at least one backup in a different physical location.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-this-means-to-me">What this means to me</h2>
<h3 id="-three-copies-of-your-data">‚úÖ Three copies of your data</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Maintain three copies: the original and two backups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For our first copy, every one of my machines has hourly Time Machine backups via an external NVMe drive. These are quick, noiseless, and reliable. Even though Time Machine keeps copies through time, I consider each drive one copy since a drive can, in theory, become corrupt.</p>
<p>Our second to third copies are from machine to machine via Syncthing with versioning turned on. If I were to lose a machine, one to three backup copies would automatically be floating on a powered-up machine.</p>
<p>I keep a third remote copy on a loud Western Digital drive that I can connect for peace of mind. I also periodically clone my boot drive to this machine to have a bootable, working copy of my main work Mac and a Time Machine backup to restore from.</p>
<h3 id="-two-different-media">‚úÖ Two different media</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Store the backups on two distinct media types or platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My local drives are NMVe drives from two vendors. I bought them when both brands were on sale when I built my last backup drives.</p>
<p>I also have a Western Digital backup drive that is a noisy, spinning disk.</p>
<h3 id="-one-off-site-backup">‚úÖ One off-site backup</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep at least one backup in a different physical location.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My main machine runs Backblaze, giving me a nightly snapshot if I need it.</p>
<p>I also have Syncthing between my home and office, giving me backup copies in two physical locations.</p>
<p>I also keep all of my projects on GitHub and GitLab, which gives me an extra copy.</p>
<h2 id="-my-portable-backup-drive-solution">üßë‚Äçüç≥ My portable backup drive solution</h2>
<p>(Links are in the parts list)</p>
<p>While I can&rsquo;t recommend that you build your backup drive, I did out of necessity because I could not find a reasonably priced solution. I was happy with the large, clunky Western Digital external drives, but they were so loud I started looking for noiseless solutions.</p>
<p>After reading many reviews, I settled on the Sabrent USB-C enclosure because it is small and barely bigger than the NVMe drives. The machine powers these drives, meaning they only need one USB-C cable to connect and power them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Based on reading review websites, I landed on the Samsung 970 EVO series drives. My first drive was a 250G drive, but I moved to 1 TB and 2 TB drives because I found them for &lt;$100 over the holiday sales.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My go-to research tool for buying almost anything is <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com">camelcamelcamel</a>. The website is free to use, and it can show you historical information so that you know if you are paying average, above, or below cost for a production on Amazon. Registering an account with them can create a price alert and get an email during a periodic sale.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> When you have two young kids who keep you home on the weekends, you quickly learn that Friday nights are the cheapest day to buy just about anything. So even if camelcamelcamel doesn&rsquo;t alert you, check out the website and on Amazon, and you&rsquo;ll see a trend. Once again, being a parent who is home on a Friday night is an excellent life hack.</p>
<h3 id="features-of-building-your-own">Features of building your own</h3>
<ul>
<li>Silent because there are no spinning disks or noisy fans</li>
<li>Portable</li>
<li>USB-C speed and ease</li>
<li>Powered over USB-C without a clunky power supply</li>
<li>They are tiny</li>
<li>BYOD - Bring your own drive</li>
<li>It takes less than a minute to assemble</li>
<li>Cheap to build - If you buy at the right time, you can build a 1 TB or 2 TB backup drive for under &lt;$100</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="parts-list">Parts list</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B08RVC6F9Y">SABRENT USB 3.2 10Gbps Type C Tool Free Enclosure</a> for $26 to $29</li>
<li>Favorite drive: <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B07MFZXR1B">SAMSUNG 970 EVO Plus SSD 2TB - M.2 NVMe</a> for $75 to $129</li>
<li>Reasonable drive: <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B09JM8DJNS">Western Digital 2TB WD Blue SN570 NVMe </a> for $85 to $129</li>
<li>Longer USB-C cable?</li>
</ul>
<p>The USB-C cable with the SABRENT is good enough, but it&rsquo;s short. It&rsquo;s fine on most of my computers, but I bought a longer Anker USB-C cable for my MacBook Pro to keep it out of the way.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect my backup drives to work as well as they did. I tried my first one out for about a year, and then I built two more last year.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When my son started kindergarten last year, I started experiencing a bit of &ldquo;carrying things withdrawal&rdquo;‚Äîfor lack of a better term.</p>
<p>We had a good routine for his first five years and the first year and a half after my daughter was born. Every Monday, we loaded everyone&rsquo;s backpacks into the car. I drove them to daycare/preschool and then went to work at the office or back home. Every Friday, we hauled the kids' stuff back. After kindergarten started, the sheer number of things multiplied to a daily backpack, water bottles, milk, and snacks, and I juggled all the things, plus carrying my one-year-old.</p>
<p>For years, I alternated between a backpack and a Satchel to carry my MacBook Pro to the office on days I was going in. I even picked up a much larger tote to bring everything and sort it out when we arrived.</p>
<p>I was burnt out on carrying things to the point that I dreamed of not having to bring anything with me except for my iPhone and my keys.</p>
<p>I was overdue for a new work machine, so I used this as an excuse to try a Mac desktop. For the office, I switched to a Mac Studio. For my home office, I picked up a Mac Mini Pro. I started using my MacBook Pro as a floater around the house and taking trips with me.</p>
<h2 id="syncing-files">Syncing files</h2>
<p>My only pain point was keeping files and projects synced between machines. I already use Apple&rsquo;s iCloud/iDisk, which takes care of my documents and random desktop files, but I wanted something else that wasn&rsquo;t Dropbox to keep my development projects always in sync.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://tailscale.com">Tailscale</a> for a few years. It creates a virtual network that allows all my devices and machines to see each other regardless of location.</p>
<p>I tried several file-syncing solutions before landing on Syncthing, which is also open-source. Syncthing appealed to me because it&rsquo;s a peer-to-peer application that doesn&rsquo;t require a server to run.</p>
<p>I wanted control over where my data was physically located, which ruled out Dropbox, iDisk, and others. Most of my projects sync from upstairs to downstairs, and no company&rsquo;s business model sits between me and my data.</p>
<p>Because all my projects are folder-based, I can share each project folder and choose which machine should have access to them. The process is more manual than I&rsquo;d like, but it&rsquo;s quick, and everything works. This also allows me to control where work and personal files are synced.</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m running Syncthing on four physical machines, which include three Macs and one Intel NUC. My NUC is my main distribution point and is wired directly into my home router, whereas my Macs are connected wirelessly.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>Setup is a breeze on Linux and macOS and only takes a few seconds with your favorite package manager. Once you install Syncthing, you can run the service and copy a key, which you can share with your other nodes so they can communicate and share files.</p>
<p>The only annoying part is keeping my <code>.stignore</code> files in sync when I find a new pattern. While I primarily develop on M2 Macs, my MacBook Pro is an Intel model. I occasionally run into a weird issue from a cache file tied to one architecture over another.</p>
<p>So far, I have landed on:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># .stignore
*.pyc
*.pyi
.*cache/
.DS_Store
.envrc
.nox/
.vendor/
docker-compose.override.yml
</code></pre><p>I wanted my <code>.git</code> folder excluded from syncing, but I changed my mind. It&rsquo;s nice to be on the same branch, no matter which machine I&rsquo;m developing on.</p>
<h2 id="the-results">The results</h2>
<p>My transition back to a desktop machine was 100% worth it. As long as I have my keys and iPhone, I have everything I need to be productive.</p>
<p>I have never noticed any latency or file syncing delays between devices. It takes less time than it takes me to walk up or down stairs to switch between devices, so that&rsquo;s a win in my book.</p>
<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>
<p>I also run Tailscale&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/tailscale/golink">golink</a> private short link service on my NUC, which makes remembering how to access Syncing things easier.</p>
<p>http://go/syncthing will redirect me to http://127.0.0.1:8384 no matter which machine I&rsquo;m on. I never have to remember which port Syncthing&rsquo;s web interface runs on again.</p>

			 <p>Python is such a fantastic glue language. Last night, while watching March Madness basketball games, I had a programming itch I wanted to scratch.</p>
<p>I dusted off a demo I wrote several years ago. It used Python&rsquo;s subprocess module, which strings together a bunch of shell commands to perform a git checkout, run a few commands, and then commit the results. The script worked, but I struggled to get it fully working in a production environment.</p>
<p>To clean things up and as an excuse to try out a new third-party package, I converted the script to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython">GitPython</a> - GitPython is a Python library used to interact with Git repositories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dgilland/shelmet">Shelmet</a> - A shell power-up for working with the file system and running subprocess commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/django-q2/django-q2">Django Q2</a> - A multiprocessing distributed task queue for Django based on Django-Q.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Django might have been overkill, but having a Repository model to work with felt nice. Django Q2 was also overkill, but if I put this app into production, I&rsquo;ll want a task queue, and Django Q2 has a manageable amount of overhead.</p>
<p>GitPython was a nice improvement over calling git commands directly because their API makes it easier to see which files were modified and to check against existing branch names. I was happy with the results after porting my subprocess commands to the GitPython API.</p>
<p>The final package I used is a new package called Shelmet, which was both a nice wrapper around subprocess plus they have a nice API for file system operations in the same vein as Python&rsquo;s Pathlib module.</p>
<h2 id="future-goals">Future goals</h2>
<p>I was tempted to cobble together a GitHub bot, but I didn&rsquo;t need one. I might dabble with the GitHub API more to fork a repo, but for now, this landed in a better place, so when I pick it back up again in a year, I&rsquo;m starting in a good place.</p>

			 <p>Recently, I have been maintaining forks for several projects that are no longer maintained. Usually, these are a pain to update, but I have found a workflow that takes the edge off by leveraging <a href="https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit">pre-commit</a>.</p>
<p>My process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fork the project on GitHub to whichever organization I work with or my personal account.</li>
<li>Check out a local copy of my forked copy with git.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit">pre-commit</a></li>
<li>Create a <code>.pre-commit-config.yaml</code> with <em>ZERO</em> formatting or lint changes. This file will only include <a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/django-upgrade">django-upgrade</a> and <a href="https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade">pyupgrade</a> hooks.</li>
</ul>
<p>We skip the formatters and linters to avoid unnecessary changes if we want to open a pull request in the upstream project. If the project isn&rsquo;t abandoned, we will want to do that.</p>
<ul>
<li>For <a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/django-upgrade">django-upgrade</a>, change the‚Äî-target-version option to target the latest version of Django I&rsquo;m upgrading to, which is currently 5.0.</li>
<li>For <a href="https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade">pyupgrade</a>, update the <code>python</code> settings under <code>default_language_version</code>  to the latest version of Python that I&rsquo;m targetting. Currently, that&rsquo;s 3.12.</li>
</ul>
<p>The django-upgrade and pyupgrade projects attempt to run several code formatters and can handle most of the more tedious upgrade steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>pre-commit autoupdate</code> to ensure we have the latest version of our hooks.</li>
<li>Run <code>pre-commit run --all-files</code> to run <code>pyupgrade</code> and <code>django-upgrade</code> on our project.</li>
<li>Run any tests contained in the project and review all changes.</li>
<li>Once I&rsquo;m comfortable with the changes, I commit them all via git and push them upstream to my branch.</li>
</ul>

			 <h1 id="2024-03-fixing-a-css-layout-issue">2024-03 Fixing a CSS layout issue</h1>
<p>I noticed a layout issue for one of my website projects while viewing a page with little content. The header and footer&rsquo;s background colors are dark, and the middle/main content area is white.</p>
<p>Where there isn&rsquo;t enough content in the main/middle content area, the footer will float up, and you&rsquo;ll see the white background behind it. Even if we change the default background color to match the header and the footer, the footer looks weird when stretched out.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a>, I figured there had to be a straightforward fix.</p>
<h2 id="layouthtml-before">layout.html before</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Flexbox for my layout set in column mode, which allows my document to grow vertically.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">body</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;flex flex-col&#34;</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">header</span>&gt;
    our heading content
  &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">header</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">main</span>&gt;
    our body content
  &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">main</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">footer</span>&gt;
    our footer content
  &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">footer</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">body</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><h2 id="layouthtml-after">layout.html after</h2>
<p>My fix involved adding two classes to my html layout. The first was adding the <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/min-height"><code>min-h-screen</code></a> class to the body element of my HTML document, so my page would always be at least the same height as my browser.</p>
<p>The second fix was adding a <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-grow"><code>flex-grow</code></a> class to the main element of my HTML layout. This tells the main element to fill any available space that&rsquo;s left over.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">body</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;flex flex-col min-h-screen&#34;</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">header</span>&gt;
    our heading content
  &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">header</span>&gt;

    our body content
  &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">main</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">footer</span>&gt;
    our footer content
  &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">footer</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">body</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>The fix was really straightforward. One could easily convert this to Vanilla CSS, but it&rsquo;s two classes, and my content works now.</p>

			 <p>I have spent a lot of mental energy thinking about how to be more defensive with the <code>robots.txt</code> files in my projects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>robots.txt</strong>¬†is the¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename" title="Filename">filename</a>¬†used for implementing the¬†<strong>Robots Exclusion Protocol</strong>, a standard used by¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website" title="Website">websites</a>¬†to indicate to visiting¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler" title="Web crawler">web crawlers</a>¬†and other¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot" title="Internet bot">web robots</a>¬†which portions of the website they are allowed to visit.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In theory, this file helps control what search engines and AI scrapers are allowed to visit, but I need more confidence in its effectiveness in the post-AI apocalyptic world.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, I have added and updated a static <code>robots.txt</code> file on several projects. Since then, I have noticed the number of known AI scrapers has doubled, and then some. See <a href="https://darkvisitors.com">Dark Visitors</a> for a comprehensive list of known AI agents.</p>
<p>Today, I decided to switch to the <a href="https://github.com/jazzband/django-robots"><code>django-robots</code></a> project because I can update it from the Django admin. Since <code>django-robot</code>&rsquo;s rules are stored in a database, I can automate updating them.</p>

			 <p>A few years back, I had a productivity conversation with <a href="https://kjaymiller.com">Jay Miller</a> about <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> plugins, which led to him sharing his <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/Bunch_Alfred">Bunch_Alfred</a> plugin. At the time, I played around with the <a href="https://bunchapp.co">Bunch.app</a>, a macOS automation tool, and Alfred&rsquo;s support was interesting.</p>
<p>I created my Alfred plugin to run <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">Just</a> command runner commands through my Alfred setup. However, I never got around to packing or writing the plugin&rsquo;s documentation.</p>
<p>My Alfred plugin runs <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/script-filter/">Script Filter Input</a>, which reads from a centrally located <code>justfile</code> and generates JSON output of all of the possible options. This will be displayed, and Alfred will run that command, whichever option you select.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was always unhappy with how the JSON document was generated from my commands, so I dusted off the project over lunch and re-engineered it by adding <a href="https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic">Pydantic</a> support.</p>
<p>Alfred just announced support for a new User Interface called <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/user-interface/text/">Text View</a>, which could make text and markdown output from Python an exciting way to handle snippets and other productive use cases. I couldn&rsquo;t quite figure it out over lunch, but now I know it&rsquo;s possible, and I might figure out how to convert my Justfile Alfred plugin to generate better output.</p>

<p>This week was Spring Break for both of my kids. My son had all week off, while my daughter had Thursday and Friday off. My son was also sick and hanging out with me the first two days of the week instead of getting to go to day camp.</p>
<p>I worked on several house projects, including cleaning our smoker and outdoor griddle. I didn&rsquo;t winterize our smoker nearly as well as I thought I had, so it took me much longer to clean than it should have.</p>

<p><strong>Django Packages:</strong> We updated our profiles to drop support for Google Code and add Bitbucket and GitLab profiles.</p>
<p><strong>Trailhawks:</strong> My local running club&rsquo;s website has been running on Django since 2009. I upgraded the project from Django 3.2 to 5.0 and to Python 3.1x, including upgrading two outdated third-party packages to Python 3.1x and Django 5. I also changed one of our race websites to Tailwind CSS, which has been in flight for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Django Packages:</strong> We released an update to our profiles to drop support for Google Code and to add Bitbucket and GitLab profiles. I also broke the website with a wsgi change, which I quickly found a fixed.</p>

			 <p>The algorithm kept telling me to make tortilla pizza, so today, over lunch, I caved and made two from a bunch of leftovers we had from the week.</p>
<p>The proteins and veggies are entirely up to you. We were out of pepperoni, so I used some leftover taco meat and stir-fried veggies (peppers and onions), which worked incredibly well.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 425F</li>
<li>Brush olive oil on the tortilla</li>
<li>Sprinkle garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Umami seasoning on top</li>
<li>Bake for 3 to 5 minutes in the preheated oven until golden</li>
<li>Remove from oven and spread tomato sauce on top. Add proteins and veggies. Sprinkle cheese and oregano on top.</li>
<li>Bake in the oven until the cheese has melted (about 5 minutes)</li>
<li>Remove, slice, and enjoy!</li>

<p>Overall, it was good, even if my photo does not reflect the taste. I have historically made my pizza dough, but for a quick fix, this was much better than the pizza dough that comes in a tube.</p>
<p>Clean-up was easy because I prepared mine on pre-cut parchment paper, which I slid on top of my pizza stone in my oven.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s springtime in the Midwest, and I took my car to get it washed earlier today. I had my oldest with me, and we decided to try out a newer car wash that we drive by a lot. When we pulled up, I was surprised the service had an app, one-off pricing, and a monthly rate for &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo; washes with four different service levels. The whole setup gave my gym vibes, and while my car was going down the conveyor belt, I wondered how many people paid for unlimited washes and didn&rsquo;t go more than twice a month to justify the cost.</p>
<p>After we got home, we did some yard work, and I tried to find care information for two of the Abelia bushes we planted last summer. We couldn&rsquo;t tell if they were dead or supposed to look like they did, but after some searching, I found <a href="https://www.gardenia.net">Gardenia</a>, which does a decent job of filling in info about random plants.</p>
<p>Years ago, after we bought our house, I started using the <a href="https://www.getsunday.com">Sunday</a> service to help me figure out how to keep our lawn healthy. The subscription service is one part lawn analysis, a soil test, bags of fertilizers that come in the mail, and a ton of information on how to keep your lawn healthy.</p>
<p>While our lawn is healthy, I still feel underwhelmed trying to keep plants and flowers alive and healthy outside our lawn. After using Sunday, why don&rsquo;t we have a similar garden service?</p>
<p>I want to find my address using &ldquo;not-Google Maps,&rdquo; pick the areas of my yard from the satellite image of my yard, and use a polygon tool to block off areas of my yard where I can grow plants.</p>
<p>The service could show me which plants will work best based on shade and the side of my house they are planted on. I would like/star the plants I want in my yard, and the service could give me advice, planting, and care details each week or month. I could visit my local nurseries to buy plants, or I would buy seeds or starter plants through the service.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m not immune to feeling tired of subscription service fatigue, I don&rsquo;t mind paying for services that teach me skills like gardening because I will waste more money failing than being shown at least the right way to start.</p>
<p>A few friends told me about joining a monthly LEGO subscription service that sends them a box of LEGOs every month. They play music or podcasts, lay out the instructions, and build the LEGO kit. Once they complete the build, they mail everything back and get another one. The beauty of LEGOs is that you follow the directions.</p>
<p>More recently, I started hearing about this trend on a few podcasts, where people like not having to decide and destress by following directions.</p>
<p>So why can&rsquo;t Gardening be more like building LEGOs?</p>

<h2 id="1-a-new-code-editor">1. A new code editor</h2>
<p>Tonight, I installed the <a href="https://zed.dev">Zed</a> code editor on a whim, and to my surprise, my LSP was automatically picked up and just worked. Zed was a surprisingly productive experience. I even spotted a bug in one of my projects that I needed help to figure out earlier today.</p>
<h2 id="2-my-favorite-theme">2. My favorite theme</h2>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t impressed with Zed&rsquo;s default theme, so I searched the <a href="https://draculatheme.com">Dracula</a> website and found a <a href="https://draculatheme.com/zed">Dracula Theme for Zed</a>. Dracula is one of my favorite themes, and they have custom-built themes for over 370 different apps.</p>
<h2 id="3-a-new-to-me-python-library">3. A new to me Python library</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dgilland/shelmet">shelmet</a> is a nice wrapper around Python&rsquo;s subprocess. The API is clean, and it has a nice wrapper around using temporary environment variables, which has been helpful for me.</p>
<h2 id="4-the-best-presentation-tool">4. The best presentation tool</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.deckset.com">Deckset</a> is the best tool for quickly writing nice-looking presentations using markdown. After years of being in private beta, they released their iOS/iPad version publicly.</p>

			 <p>Last month, I wrote <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/02/29/pythons-uv-tool.html">Python&rsquo;s UV tool is actually pretty good</a> about Astral&rsquo;s new Python package installer and resolver  <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv"><code>uv</code></a>, and this is a follow-up post.</p>
<p>Since last month, I have added <code>uv</code> to over a dozen projects, and I recently learned that you could skip the <code>venv</code> step for projects that use containers or CI where the environment is already isolated.</p>
<p>I mistakenly thought <code>uv</code> required a virtual environment (aka venv), but <a href="https://joshthomas.dev">Josh Thomas</a> recently pointed out that it&rsquo;s unnecessary.</p>
<p>The trick is to pass the <code>--system</code> option, and <code>uv</code> will perform a system-wide install. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">uv pip install --system --requirement requirement.txt
</code></pre></div><p>Now that I have seen this, I wish <code>pip</code> also used this approach to avoid developers accidentally installing third-party packages globally.</p>

<p>Nothing has changed with my <code>justfile</code> example from last month.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m working with containers, I create a virtual environment (venv) because I will need most of my project requirements installed <em>outside</em> of the container so that my text editor and LSP can resolve dependencies. <code>uv</code>&rsquo;s default behavior of respecting a <code>venv</code> is all we need here.</p>
<p>Every one of my projects has a <code>justfile</code> (it&rsquo;s like Make but works the same everywhere) with &ldquo;bootstrap&rdquo; and &ldquo;lock&rdquo; recipes. My &ldquo;bootstrap&rdquo; recipe installs everything I need to work with the project locally. I use my &ldquo;lock&rdquo; recipe to lock my <code>requirements.txt</code> file to use the exact requirements locally and in production.</p>
<h3 id="justfile-before"><code>justfile</code> before</h3>
<p>My <code>justfile</code> might look like this:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Brett&rsquo;s thread and our conversation reminded me that my rule for working with dotenv files is to have my environment load them instead of my Python app trying to read from the <code>.env</code> file directly.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-env-dotenv-file">What is a <code>.env</code> (dotenv) file?</h2>
<p>A <code>.env</code> (aka dotenv) is a file that contains a list of key-value pairs in the format of <code>{key}=value</code>.</p>
<p>At a basic level, this is what a bare minimum <code>.env</code> file might look for in a Django project.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="color:#75715e"># .env</span>
DEBUG<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>true
SECRET_KEY<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>you need to change this
</code></pre></div><p>My go-to library for reading ENV variables is <a href="https://github.com/sloria/environs"><code>environs</code></a>. While the <code>environs</code> library can read directly from a dotenv file, don&rsquo;t do that. I never want my program to read from a file in production because I don&rsquo;t want a physical file with all of my API keys and secrets.</p>
<p>Most hosting providers, like <a href="https://fly.io">Fly.io</a>, have a command line interface for setting these key-value pairs in production to avoid needing a physical dotenv file.</p>
<p>Instead, we should default to assuming that the ENV variables will bet in our environment, and we should fall back to either a reasonable default value or fail loudly.</p>
<p>Using the <code>environs</code> library, my Django <code>settings.py</code> file tends to look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#75715e"># settings.py</span>

env <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> environs<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>Env()

<span style="color:#75715e"># this will default to False if not set.</span>
DEBUG <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> env<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>bool(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;DJANGO_DEBUG&#34;</span>, default<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">False</span>)

<span style="color:#75715e"># this will error loudly if not set</span>
SECRET_KEY <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> env<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>str(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;SECRET_KEY&#34;</span>)

<span style="color:#75715e"># everything else... </span>
</code></pre></div><p>I lean on Docker Compose for local development when I&rsquo;m building web apps because I might have three to five services running. Compose can read a dotenv file and register them into environment variables.</p>
<h2 id="envrc-files-arent-env-files"><code>.envrc</code> files aren&rsquo;t <code>.env</code> files</h2>
<p>On my macOS, when I&rsquo;m not developing in a container, I use the <a href="https://direnv.net"><code>direnv</code></a> application to read an <code>.envrc</code> file which is very similar to a dotenv file.</p>
<p>A <code>.envrc</code> is very similar to a <code>.env</code> file, but to register the values into memory, you have to use Bash&rsquo;s <code>export</code> convention. If you don&rsquo;t specify <code>export</code>, the environment variables won&rsquo;t be available in your existing Bash environment.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="color:#75715e"># .envrc</span>
export DEBUG<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>true
export SECRET_KEY<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>you need to change this
</code></pre></div><p>I&rsquo;m a fan of <code>direnv</code> because the utility ensures that my environment variables are only set while I am in the same folder or sub-folders that contain the <code>.envrc</code> file. If I move to a different folder location or project, <code>direnv</code> will automatically unload every environment variable that was previously set.</p>
<p>This has saved me numerous times over the years when I have run a command that might upload a file to s3 and ensure that I&rsquo;m not uploading to the wrong account because an environment variable is still set from another project.</p>
<p>Clients are generally understanding, but overriding static media for one client with another client&rsquo;s files is not a conversation I want to have with any client.</p>
<p><code>direnv</code> is excellent insurance against forgetting to unset an environment variable.</p>
<h2 id="seeding-a-env-file">Seeding a <code>.env</code> file</h2>
<p>I prefer to ship an example <code>.env.example</code> file in my projects with reasonable defaults and instructions for copying them over.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="color:#75715e"># .env.example</span>

</code></pre></div><p>If you are a <a href="https://github.com/casey/just"><code>casey/just</code></a> <code>justfile</code> user, I like to ship a <code>just bootstrap</code> recipe that checks if a <code>.env</code> file already exists. If the <code>.env</code> file does not exist, it will copy the example in place.</p>
<p>My <code>bootstrap</code> recipe typically looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="color:#75715e"># justfile</span>

    <span style="color:#ae81ff">if [ ! -f &#34;.env&#34; ]; then</span>
        <span style="color:#ae81ff">echo &#34;.env created&#34;</span>
        <span style="color:#ae81ff">cp .env.example .env</span>
    <span style="color:#ae81ff">fi</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="how-do-we-keep-dotenv-files-in-sync">How do we keep dotenv files in sync?</h2>
<p>One pain point when working with dotenv files is keeping new environment variables updated when a new variable has been added.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://github.com/kurtbuilds/modenv">modenv</a> is an excellent utility that can do precisely this. I run <code>modenv check</code> and will compare the <code>.env*</code> files in the existing folder. It will tell us which files are missing an environment variable when it exists in one but not one of the other files.</p>
<p>I use <code>modenv check -f</code> to sync up any missing keys with a blank value. This works well to sync up any new environment variables added to our <code>.env.example</code> file with our local <code>.env</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>
<p>I recently wrote about <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/02/21/using-chamber-with.html">Using Chamber with Django and managing environment variables</a>, which dives into using Chamber, another tool for managing environment variables.</p>
<p>If you are working with a team, the <a href="https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/secrets-environment-variables/">1Password CLI</a>&rsquo;s <code>op run</code> command is an excellent way to share environment variables securely. The tool is straightforward and can be integrated securely with local workflows and CI with just a few steps.</p>

			 <p>Last week, during office hours, I shared the two libraries that were my gateways to learning Python.</p>
<h2 id="cog">Cog</h2>
<p>I stumbled on Ned Batchelder&rsquo;s <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/">Cog</a> while running an ISP in SWMO in the mid-00s. At the time, I was writing lots of PHP code and had a few layers of ORM code that I could generate with Cog&rsquo;s help. This code was mainly boilerplate, and Cog was great at templating code. Thankfully, I didn&rsquo;t need to know Python with Cog to make it work.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have still used Cog to update docs and to document Justfiles, Click, Typer,  and console apps by grabbing the output and embedding it into docs.</p>
<h2 id="beautiful-soup">Beautiful Soup</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> is the library that pushed me to learn Python. 
Beautiful Soup motivated me to learn Python and even more advanced feats like installing LXML and processing unparseable HTML or XML. 
I have always liked writing web scrapers and processing HTML documents, which is a weird hobby of mine.</p>
<h2 id="my-first-python-app">My first Python app</h2>
<p>My friends and I worked in our first post-college dot com job, and Dell was running an incredible deal on their 20&quot; widescreen monitors over the Christmas holiday.</p>
<p>Dell ran a daily Dell Elf (Delf) contest where you gave them your email address, and they would give you a discount code for their various products.</p>
<p>The best code was 50% off of their 20&quot; widescreen displays, which was an incredible deal then. The display retailed for $499, so getting one for $249.50 was great. These codes were random, and the odds were 1 in 25 to get one.</p>
<p>Using Python and having an email catchall, I wrote my first script to submit a series of email addresses until we found the daily 50% off code. At least four or five of my friends and I stocked up on these monitors that fall, and I have been a fan of Dell displays ever since.</p>
<h2 id="today">Today</h2>
<p>I still use Cog and Beautiful Soup 4 in several projects, including a few daily drivers. Last year, during their end-of-year sale, I picked three Dell 27-inch displays, and I still have fond memories of Dell&rsquo;s displays.</p>

<h2 id="family">Family</h2>
<p>My oldest was out two days this week at parent-teacher conferences, and next week, he has off for Spring Break. He missed his last basketball practice and game because he&rsquo;s had a bug for a few days with a runny nose and a low fever that keeps coming back.</p>
<p>My youngest child is firmly in the four to six-word sentence phase. We are up to our eyeballs in potty training, and my daughter&rsquo;s new favorite phrase is, &ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; when you suggest we try again.</p>
<p>The kid&rsquo;s grandfather drove down from Chicago to spend the weekend with us.</p>
<p>I picked up Oliver&rsquo;s bug on Saturday and spent it more down than up, so my new compound miter saw sat in the box all weekend.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>We are a few weeks into a new client project, and that&rsquo;s led to several refactors and working with newer tools, including Pydantic and Django Ninja for Model Schemas. I also expect to spend much time in Tailwind CSS land soon.</p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>We had our monthly DEFNA meeting, elected officers, and discussed upcoming announcements.</p>
<p>I had a PSF Code of Conduct WG meeting that conflicted with morning kid drop-offs, but I could join for the last 15 to 20 minutes to help them make a quorum so we could vote to pass a few things.</p>

<p>I spent most of my side project time on <a href="https://django-news.com">Django News</a>, <a href="https://jobs.django-news.com">Django News Jobs</a>, and <a href="https://djangopackages.org">Django Packages</a> and upgraded several projects to the latest Django 5.0.x security release and Python 3.12 releases. I also moved several projects to use <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> Python package manager, including <a href="https://djangopackages.org">Django Packages</a> and <a href="https://jobs.django-news.com">Django News Jobs</a>, which shaves minutes off of build times.</p>

<p>I started on a Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS conversion tool after noticing that several popular tools last updated 3 to 6 years ago. I can brute force about 90% of it, but I have also meant to play around with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cssutils/"><code>cssutils</code></a> for a while. With <code>cssutils</code>, I think it might be possible to read from the various Bootstrap CSS versions and match up to some Tailwind CSS classes by comparing them via their CSS output.</p>

			 <p>I spent a few hours tonight weighing my options to port a few websites from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS.</p>
<p>I started with what seems to be the original <a href="https://github.com/awssat/tailwindo"><code>awssat/tailwindo</code></a> project is a PHP console app whose goal was to convert any Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS and was last updated three years ago. I couldn&rsquo;t get it to work from the console or via Docker, so I punted and looked at other options.</p>
<p>This led me to the <a href="https://github.com/riazXrazor/node-tailwindo"><code>node-tailwindo</code></a> project, which did install successfully for me. <code>node-tailwindo</code> project hadn&rsquo;t been updated in six years, so much has changed in both projects.</p>
<p>Since <code>node-tailwindo</code> was installed successfully and seemed to run OK, I ran it on a few projects, including <a href="https://djangopackages.org">Django Packages</a>, and the results were not terrible. They were not amazing, but things worked.</p>
<p>I looked at commercial options, and they fall into either Browser Extensions that let you view an existing website with a copy/convert to Tailwind CSS option or tools that rewrite your existing CSS. Neither felt like a good option to me.</p>
<p>I finally did what any Python developer would and installed <a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">BeautifulSoup4</a>. Next, I wrote a script to read all the files in a template folder, and it extracted all the class attributes from the existing HTML. One hundred seventy-six unique classes later, I had my answer.</p>
<p>Writing my upgrade tool felt like a bigger project that I wanted to take on, but it helped me spot a few issues that <code>node-tailwindo</code> would struggle with.</p>
<p>This is where BeautifulSoup4 shines, and I could quickly swap out a few classes before I fed them into <code>node-tailwindo</code>, and it fixes several bugs where the project was confused by <code>{% block %}</code> and  <code>&amp;#123;&amp;#123; variable }}</code> tags/blocks.</p>
<p>This might be a project; I slowly update as I get bored since I can probably add and test 10 to 20 tests over lunch. For a brief minute, I debated if this would be my first Rust app. Spoiler: It is not.</p>

			 <p>Dave the Diver is a fun game for such a random, quirky, and so many game-styles / mini-games all mashed together. In the game, you play Dave, who dives and explores the sea by day, and you run a sushi restaurant by night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the few games where I pushed to get the endgame out of the way to resume running my sushi restaurant, maxing out my employees, and completing my dive adventures/collecting. Even after a few months, I still enjoy playing day-to-day activities.</p>

<p>Here are some notes on how I prefer to test views for a Django application with authentication using <a href="https://github.com/TvoroG/pytest-lazy-fixture">pytest-lazy-fixture</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fixtures">Fixtures</h2>
<p><code>pytest-django</code> has a <a href="https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/helpers.html#django-user-model"><code>django_user_model</code></a> fixture/shortcut, which I recommend using to create valid Django user accounts for your project.</p>
<p>This example assumes that there are four levels of users. We have anonymous (not authenticated), &ldquo;user,&rdquo; staff, and superuser levels of permission to work with. Both staff and superusers follow the Django default pattern and have the <code>is_staff</code> and <code>is_superuser</code> boolean fields set appropriately.</p>

<p>We will assume that our website has some working Category pages that can only viewed by staff or superusers. The <code>lazy_fixture</code> library allows us to pass the name of a fixture using parametrize along with the expected status_code that our view should return.</p>
<p>If you have never seen <code>parametrize</code>, it is a nice pytest convention that will re-run the same test multiple times while passing a list of parameters into the test to be evaluated.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> These status codes are more typical for a REST API. So I would adjust any 40x status codes accordingly.</p>
<p>My goal in sharing these examples is to show that you can get some helpful testing in with a little bit of code, even if the goal isn&rsquo;t to dive deep and cover everything.</p>
<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
<p>To make my example more consistent, I updated <code>@pytest.mark.django_db()</code> to use a <code>db</code> fixture. Thank you, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@bennylope@social.benlopatin.com/112060829098386312">Ben Lopatin</a>, for the feedback.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have recently been playing with <a href="https://github.com/vitalik/django-ninja">Django Ninja</a> for small APIs and for leveraging Schema. Specifically, <a href="https://django-ninja.dev/guides/response/django-pydantic/">ModelSchema</a> is worth checking out because it&rsquo;s a hidden gem for working with Django models, even if you aren&rsquo;t interested in building a Rest API.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Schemas are very useful to define your validation rules and responses, but sometimes you need to reflect your database models into schemas and keep changes in sync.
<a href="https://django-ninja.dev/guides/response/django-pydantic/">https://django-ninja.dev/guides/response/django-pydantic/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One challenge we face is importing data from one legacy database into a new database with a different structure. While we can map old fields to new fields using a Python dictionary, we also need more control over what the data looks like coming back out.</p>
<p>Thankfully, ModelSchema is built on top of <a href="%5BPydantic%5D(https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)">Pydantic</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.6/api/base_model/">BaseModel</a> and supports Pydantic&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/fields/#pydantic.fields.Field">Field alias</a> feature.</p>
<p>This allows us to create a ModelSchema based on a LegacyCategory model, and we can build out <code>Field(alias=&quot;...&quot;)</code> types to change the shape of how the data is returned.</p>
<p>We can then store the result as a Python dictionary and insert it into our new model. We can also log a JSON representation of the instance to make debugging easier. See <a href="https://django-ninja.dev/guides/response/#serializing-outside-of-views">Serializing Outside of Views</a> for an overview of how the <code>from_orm</code> API works.</p>
<p>To test this, I built a proof of concept Django management command using <a href="https://github.com/GaretJax/django-click">django-click</a>, which loops through all our legacy category models and prints them.</p>

			 <p>Recently, I have been slowly moving several of my side projects and client projects from various Python versions to Python 3.12.</p>
<p>I never see people write about this, so it might be nice to write and share some notes.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h2>
<p>The first thing we do with a relatively simple upgrade is figure out what Python version we use. Thankfully, the project we picked mentioned in the README.md that it was using Python 3.11.</p>
<p>Once we know which version of Python we are using, we can open up iTerm and get a git checkout of the project.</p>
<p>Next, we will run <code>git grep 11</code>, where &ldquo;11&rdquo; is the shortened form of the Python version that we are running. There are so many variations of <code>3.11</code> and <code>311</code> that using the minor version tends to be about right.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ git grep <span style="color:#ae81ff">11</span>
... really long list...

.github/workflows/actions.yml:      - name: Set up Python 3.11

... lots and lots of files...
</code></pre></div><p>This output will give us a long list of files. Usually, this is 100s or 1000s of files we will pipe or copy into our code editor. We will make a few passes to remove all of the CSS, SVG, and HTML files in the list, and that pairs down the results to half a dozen or a dozen files.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-new-git-branch">Create a new git branch</h2>
<p>Next, we will create a new git branch called <code>upgrade-to-python-3.12</code>, and we will open each file one by one, and replace every &ldquo;3.11&rdquo; and &ldquo;311&rdquo; reference with &ldquo;3.12&rdquo; and &ldquo;312&rdquo; respectively.</p>
<h2 id="lintformat-our-code-base">Lint/format our code base</h2>
<p>Once we have all of our files updated, we will commit everything. Then we will note special files like <code>.pre-commit-config.yaml</code> and <code>pyproject.toml</code>, impacting how my Python files are linted and formatted. Then, we will run <code>pre-commit</code> immediately after and commit any formatting changes.</p>
<h2 id="rebuild-our-docker-image">Rebuild our Docker image</h2>
<p>Since this project contains <code>docker/Dockerfile</code> that tells us the project uses Docker, we will need to rebuild our container image and note anything that breaks.</p>
<h2 id="re-pinfreeze-our-python-dependencies">Re-pin/freeze our Python dependencies</h2>
<p>Next, we will run <code>pip-tools</code> <code>compile</code> from within our newly rebuilt Docker container to build a new <code>requirements.txt</code> using Python 3.12.</p>
<h2 id="re-rebuild-our-docker-image-again">Re-rebuild our Docker image (again)</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Insert Xzibit Yo Dawg meme.&quot;</strong> Next, we rebuild our Docker image using the newly pinned <code>requirements.txt</code> file, and this should be our final image.</p>
<h2 id="did-our-tests-pass">Did our tests pass?</h2>
<p>Assuming Docker builds cleanly, we will run my test suite using <code>pytest</code>. Once our tests pass, we&rsquo;ll commit any uncommitted changes, <code>git push</code> our branch to GitHub, and open a Pull Request for review.</p>
<h2 id="did-our-tests-pass-in-ci">Did our tests pass in CI?</h2>
<p>If our tests pass on GitHub Actions in CI, then we know our upgrade was successful, and we are reasonably confident that</p>
<h2 id="when-things-dont-just-work">When things don&rsquo;t &ldquo;just work.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>If you keep up with your upgrades, most of the time, everything works. Half a dozen projects did work for me, but I had one that did not work on Monday. There was a sub-dependency issue, so I closed my branch and opened a new issue to revisit this upgrade once the next version of Python 3.12.3 is released.</p>
<p>Even though this wasn&rsquo;t a Python 3.12.2 bug, it takes the Python ecosystem time to catch up with newer versions. Since Python 3.11 is still supported for another <a href="https://endoflife.date/python">3 years and 7 months</a> (as of this writing), it won&rsquo;t hurt to wait a few weeks or months and revisit these changes.</p>
<p>If you are curious about how I decide when to adopt a new version, I wrote about that last month: <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/02/01/choosing-the-right.html">Choosing the Right Python and Django Versions for Your Projects</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just updated my ~/.config/pip/pip.conf &amp; my dotfiles repo to disallow pip installing outside virtual environments! üéâ</p>
<p>TIL 2 things about #Python&rsquo;s pip:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>pip has a config file. If I ever knew this, I&rsquo;d forgotten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pip has an option that stops it from working outside of a virtual environment!</p>
</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>
<p>To Trey&rsquo;s point, I never pip to install to easily install anything globally. If I want something installed globally, I can jump through a few hoops to avoid polluting my global pip cache.</p>
<p>My preferred way of disallowing pip installation outside virtual environments is to use the <code>PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>I have <code>export PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true</code> set in my <code>.bash_profile</code>, which is part of my <a href="https://github.com/jefftriplett/dotfiles"><code>dotfiles</code></a>. I prefer the ENV approach because I share my files over many computers, and it&rsquo;s one less file to keep up with.</p>
<p>When I want to <code>pip install</code> something globally, I use <a href="https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/"><code>pipx</code></a>, which installs each Python application into its isolated environment.</p>
<p>For the few times that I do need to install a Python application globally, I use:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>I have this recipe baked into my <a href="https://github.com/jefftriplett/dotfiles/blob/f59e2884daace42be404c1f028ea7312fed0bab2/home/justfile#L159-L168">global justfile</a> so I can quickly apply upgrades.</p>

<p>One set of my grandparents lived next door to me when I was a kid, and they had a fantastic wood shop. Everything is quick work when you have the right tool.</p>
<p>When starting from scratch, every project feels like it should be easy until you hit a wall of existential dread because you don&rsquo;t have the right power tool, saw blade, or shop essential to complete it.</p>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s guide is approachable, and I already have a few recommended tools, which takes the edge off. I need a good miter saw and, eventually, a table saw, for which Steve provides recommendations and links.</p>
<p>So here goes nothing. I just ordered my first compound miter saw and combination square. This is the one time I am okay with someone making an Amazon affiliate sale off of my clicking a link.</p>

I use <code>django-startproject</code> to spin up projects that need some batteries quickly, but not every battery.</p>
<p>Features:</p>

<li>Python 3.12</li>
<li>Docker Compose 3</li>
<li>Adds <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">casey/just</a> recipes/workflows (Just is a command runner, not a build tool)</li>

</ul>
<p><code>uv</code> is the newest addition, which is a Python package installer and <a href="https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/">pip-tools</a> replacement. It&rsquo;s not a 100% drop-in replacement for pip and pip-tools, but it cuts my build times in half, and I have yet to hit any significant show-stoppers.</p>

<h2 id="writing-tools">Writing tools</h2>
<p>Every year, I put &ldquo;write more&rdquo; on my list of goals, and every year, I look back and realize some invisible barrier gets in my way. I get easily frustrated with every writing tool I have ever used, and my brain obsesses over the platform&rsquo;s limitations.</p>
<p>I had a little bit of new writing tool productivity with both <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> and <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> which were both invaluable to me.</p>
<p>Writing every day in February instilled in me that Obsidian is the best writing platform for me. I even paid for a <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Licenses+and+payment/Catalyst+license">Catalyst license</a> to support Obsidian&rsquo;s development.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> also made it easy to post every day, and I suspect it will shape and heavily influence my blog platform going forward. I&rsquo;m still annoyed that I can&rsquo;t upload images or edit my social media posts with it, but once I understood the service&rsquo;s limitations, it never got in my way.</p>
<h2 id="going-forward">Going forward</h2>
<p>My existing blog uses GitHub Pages and Jekyll, but I&rsquo;m ready to return to Django with a basic REST API for posting new blog posts and links.</p>
<p>My existing blog is built with Frontmatter, Markdown, and Yaml, which makes importing and editing everything doable with Python and a text editor.</p>
<p>I plan to use a mix of Obsidian with a custom Python script that can publish and sync to my website until I find a nice JS writing interface that I like.</p>
<p>Now that Obsidian supports <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties">Properties</a> via Frontmatter, I can store my Post metadata between my text files and my blog to sync between the two.</p>
<p>I also want a slick <a href="https://typefully.com">Typefully</a>-like experience for quick posts. Just one big markdown-friendly writing area that can handle dragging and dropping images to it. I want to pick where I am publishing when I choose to publish.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I plan to go next.</p>

			 <p>I carved out some time recently to start playing with the new Python package installer and resolver, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv"><code>uv</code></a>.</p>
<p><code>uv</code> makes big promises and claims to be 10-100x faster than pip and pip-tools. From my experiments over the last few weeks, it lives up to this promise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using it locally for my virtual environments, in my Dockerfiles to rebuild my containers, and for CI using GitHub Actions. Across the board, anything I do with <code>pip</code> or <code>pip-tools</code> is remarkably faster.</p>
<p>My average GitHub Actions CI workflows dropped from ~2 minutes to 50 seconds. This cuts the minutes I use in half and, in theory, my monthly bill in half.</p>
<p>My goal in sharing my configs is more &ldquo;show&rdquo; than &ldquo;tell' because I will copy and paste these for weeks and months to come.</p>
<h2 id="local-development">local development</h2>
<p>Every one of my projects has a <code>justfile</code> (it&rsquo;s like Make but works the same everywhere) with &ldquo;bootstrap&rdquo; and &ldquo;lock&rdquo; recipes. My &ldquo;bootstrap&rdquo; recipe installs everything I need to work with the project locally. I use my &ldquo;lock&rdquo; recipe to lock my requirements.txt file so that I&rsquo;m using the exact requirements locally and in production.</p>

			 <p>A few months ago, PayPal reached out to me via my backup email address to let me know that my primary email address no longer worked.</p>
<p>I knew fixing this would be painful, so I wrote down the steps as I walked through it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sends a few test emails from Gmail</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="back-to-fastmail">Back to Fastmail</h2>
<p>After poking around, I noticed that Fastmail dropped my alias for &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find with search reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I re-added my alias and double check that <code>*@domain.com</code> was still set to forward email.</p>
<p>I send a few more test emails, get a few failures, and I notice it&rsquo;s back up and working again.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-paypal">Back to PayPal</h2>
<ul>
<li>I return to PayPal to re-add my email address, which triggers another test SMS/email.</li>
<li>I pull the code and re-enter into PayPal to verify my email address works again.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fastmail-support">Fastmail support</h2>
<ul>
<li>I contacted Fastmail&rsquo;s support, who told me this email address had never existed in their system. I have used it every month, dating back over 14 years, and it has existed since the late 90s.</li>
<li>I re-create the email address.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="back-to-gmail-1">Back to Gmail</h2>
<ul>
<li>I tested sending an email from Gmail again, and it works.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="back-to-paypal-1">Back to PayPal</h2>

<h2 id="back-to-fastmail-1">Back to Fastmail</h2>
<ul>
<li>I re-tested from Fastmail, and now everything is working again.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fin">Fin</h2>
<p>This should have ended with me throwing everything away and quitting the Internet, but here we are months later.</p>
<p>Instead, I have consolidated more of my DNS and domain services so that everything is easier to find and manage, but what a mess.</p>
<p>I lost a ton of faith in Fastmail, but I also needed more patience to push back on support to understand how and why my email forwarders and backup catchall were deleted.</p>

		<a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/02/27/using-django-q/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-02-27 23:23:33 -0500">Feb 27, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m long overdue to write about how <a href="https://github.com/django-q2/django-q2">Django Q2</a> has become part of my development toolkit. As the maintained successor to <a href="https://github.com/Koed00/django-q">Django Q</a>, Django Q2 extends Django to handle background tasks and scheduled jobs.</p>
<p>Django Q2 is flexible in managing tasks, whether sending out daily emails or performing hourly tasks like checking RSS feeds. The project works seamlessly with Django, making it one of the more straightforward background task solutions to integrate into your projects.</p>
<p>Using Django Q2 involves passing a method or a string reference to a method to an <a href="https://django-q2.readthedocs.io/en/master/tasks.html#async-task"><code>async_task()</code></a> function, which will run in the background.</p>
<p>One feature of Django Q2 that particularly impresses me is its adaptability to various databases. Whether your project uses the default Django database or something more scalable like Redis, Django Q2 fits perfectly. This flexibility means that a database queue suffices without any hiccups for most of my projects, even those that are small to medium.</p>
<p>Unlike other task queues that require managing multiple processes or services, Django Q2 keeps it simple. The only necessity is to have the <code>qcluster</code> management command running, which is a breeze compared to other task queues because you only need to run one service to handle everything.</p>
<p>Django Q2&rsquo;s flexibility, ease of use, and seamless integration with Django make it an excellent tool to reach for when you need background tasks.</p>

<p>Like Brenton, I have a lot of projects, and their scope may range from quick one-offs that might last a few hours to projects I have worked on for a decade or more.</p>
<h2 id="overview-and-upfront-notes">Overview and upfront notes</h2>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a> to manage my Python versions, but I don&rsquo;t go into any details here.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenvwrapper">pyenv-virtualenvwrapper</a> to manage what Python calls a &ldquo;virtual environment,&rdquo; which copies and symlinks files and folders where they need to be so that your Python projects are isolated from one another.</p>
<p><code>pyenv-virtualenvwrapper</code> is also a <code>pyenv</code>-friendly fork of <a href="https://github.com/python-virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper">virtualenvwrapper</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> To avoid even more confusion, please assume that at any time in this article, when I mention <code>virtualenvwrapper</code> or its various commands, I mean the <code>pyenv-virtualenvwrapper</code> version of these tools.</p>
<p>For more detail, see my article <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/02/10/python-development-on.html">Python Development on macOS Notes: pyenv and pyenv-virtualenvwrapper</a>.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-project">Creating a new project</h2>
<p>First, I need a folder to store all my project files. One nice feature of <code>virtualenvwrapper</code> is it can manage both my virtualenvs and where my projects live.</p>
<p>So my first step for a new project is to run <code>mkvirtualenv {project_name}</code>, where <code>project_name</code> is the name of the domain name or client that I&rsquo;m working with. <code>mkvirtualenv</code> will then create a new virtual environment (<code>virtualenv</code> or <code>venv</code> is fine too) for me, make a new project folder for me to put my files into, and then transport me to this new project folder.</p>
<p><code>virtualenvwrapper</code> also supports custom hooks, which is a fancy way of saying it runs a series of commands I tell it I want to run after it creates a <code>virtualenv</code>. These are a few of the custom steps that I run for my projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-4">Sublime Text</a> project file so <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> can detect it.</li>
<li>Create a <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-4">Sublime Text</a> <code>pyrightconfig.json</code> file, which enables LSP support for the project so that my code autocompletion works.</li>
<li>Create a <a href="https://syncthing.net">Syncthing</a> <code>.stignore</code>  file.</li>
<li>Create a <a href="https://direnv.net">direnv</a> <code>.envrc</code> file that loads my project&rsquo;s environment variables.</li>
<li>Transports me into my projects folder.</li>
<li>Activate the new <code>virtualenv</code>, so Python is ready.</li>
<li>Install the latest version of <code>pip</code>, Python&rsquo;s package manager.</li>
<li>Install the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/">pip-tools</a>, which I like to use for managing my project Python requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Soon:</strong> Install the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a>, which will soon replace pip-tools for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though most of my projects use Docker Compose, I still install my Python dependencies outside of Docker in the virtual environment so that my text editors and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/pyright">pyright</a> can read them.</p>
<h2 id="create-my-django-app">Create my Django app</h2>
<p>Once I have a project folder and <code>virtualenv</code> set up, I must create a Django project.
I use either my <a href="https://github.com/jefftriplett/django-startproject">django-startproject</a> or <a href="https://revsys.com">REVSYS</a>&rsquo;s Django starter template, which we call AlphaKit.
Both projects aim to start jumpstart development and spend zero time configuring projects.
Since my stater project is public, I will run this snippet to jumpstart it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">django-admin startproject <span style="color:#ae81ff">\

</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>    config
</code></pre></div><p>I landed on <code>config</code> for my projects because I like consistency when switching between projects, and over a decade and a half, I have never had a naming collision with config. The name config tends to sort to the top of my folder listings, making copying and pasting configs from project to project easier.</p>
<h2 id="setup-git">Setup Git</h2>
<ol>
<li>Now that I have my project started, I will run <code>git init</code> inside the project folder.</li>
<li><code>bunx gitignore python</code> to set standard files to ignore</li>
<li>I will create a new repo on Git(Hub|Lab) and set it as a remote source for my project</li>
<li>I will run <code>gittower .</code>, select which files I&rsquo;m ready to commit, and write my initial commit message.</li>
<li>I will <code>git push</code> from my terminal or <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/mac">GitTower</a> and confirm that my new project is set up.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="switching-projects">Switching projects</h2>
<p>When I want to work on an existing project, I use <code>virtualenv</code>&rsquo;s <code>workon</code> command to switch projects. <code>workon {project_name}</code> will transport me to the correct project folder and will activate my Python virtual environment so that I&rsquo;m ready to work.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-templates">Do I need templates?</h2>
<p>If my project needs templates, I&rsquo;ll use a starter <code>templates/base.html</code> and the <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn">Tailwind CSS Play CDN</a>.</p>
<p>I am a few years into using Tailwind CSS, and it&rsquo;s my first choice for quickly bootstrapping a project. Despite the masto-hate, Tailwind CSS works for me and is vanilla CSS-friendly.</p>
<p>I like their Play CDN because I can start fiddling with Tailwind CSS with zero runtime and only one script tag to include in my HTML docs head.</p>

			 <p>It warmed up this week, and we started our mornings out in the 30s and ended them in the 60s and even 70s all week. Our neighbors started putting their furniture back out on their porches, which is a local sign that winter is almost over.</p>

<p>I started a new client project this week, which involved spinning up a new green field project, taking a bunch of CSV files, and importing millions of records. The goal is to use Django, HTMX, and a lot of neat tech to build a vast parts catalog.</p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>We met to discuss our <a href="https://2024.djangocon.us">DjangoCon US</a> website options as we try to figure out what we want in a new platform. We had a follow-up meeting about our Health and Safety policies, and I also had a meeting to help onboard someone to assist with our automation projects.</p>

<p>I hosted <a href="https://mastodon.social/@webology/111983160101281972">Office Hours</a> again this week.</p>
<h2 id="side-projects">Side Projects</h2>
<p>I spent most of my side project time on <a href="https://django-news.com">Django News</a>, <a href="https://jobs.django-news.com">Django News Jobs</a>, and <a href="https://djangopackages.org">Django Packages</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Django News Jobs:</strong> I fixed several bugs, styled some message notifications, and refactored how various job status states work. We have different workflows for when a human submits a job versus jobs we collect from RSS feeds, APIs, or scraped. Most of these jobs are collected but have yet to be displayed. They should start seeing the light of day once I get a better handle on a moderation queue.</p>
<p><strong>Django Packages:</strong> The website now runs on <a href="https://github.com/djangopackages/djangopackages/pull/1105">Django 5.0</a> thanks to <a href="https://github.com/saadmk11">Maksudul Haque</a>. I merged in several rounds of dependency updates and pre-commit updates.</p>
<p><strong>Django News Newsletter:</strong> We shipped issue <a href="https://django-news.com/issues/220#start">#220</a>. I worked on our secret backend project, which helps us collect news and makes updating the newsletter easier. I migrated our Tweet model to a Drafts model and dusted off some code that would post via the <a href="https://typefully.com">Typefully</a> API.</p>
<p>All three projects received security updates, and I created a new blog app called the Changelog, which we&rsquo;ll slowly roll out over the next few weeks or months. That should help us blog about project updates and release and share thoughts.</p>
<p>I started using the <a href="https://astral.sh/blog/uv"><code>uv</code></a> project to shave a minute or more off local updates and some Docker rebuilds. I&rsquo;m trying it out for a week and then rolling it out.</p>

			 <p>For the last few months, I have been using the <a href="https://cooked.wiki">cooked.wiki</a> recipe-saving website, which initially impressed me because of how easy the website&rsquo;s API is to use.</p>
<p>To use the service, all one has to do is prepend any website that contains a food recipe with <code>https://cooked.wiki/</code>, and you get the recipe without a coming-of-age discovery story.</p>
<p>This is a fun pattern, so I wrote my own in Django to illustrate how to build a Django view, which accepts a URL like http://localhost:8000/https://httpbin.org/get/ where <a href="https://httpbin.org/get/">https://httpbin.org/get/</a> will be fetched and the contents stored for processing.</p>

			 <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>¬†Forward Email did <em>not</em> pay me to write this.¬†</p>
<p>I wrote about my side projects and how <a href="https://jefftriplett.com/2021/side-projects-email-is-a-pain/">email is a pain</a> a few years ago, and this morning, I saw a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@zrail@hachyderm.io/111981176443853726">Mastodon post</a> that led me back here.¬†</p>
<p>At the time, I ran into a point with my side projects where they would grow up and eventually need an email address dedicated to them. Instead of trying to manage a dozen email accounts, I stumbled on <a href="https://forwardemail.net">Forward Email</a>, and they solved the problem by allowing me to forward emails to other email accounts. Three years and annual billing cycles later, the service works.¬†</p>
<p>This morning, I discovered they now support <a href="https://forwardemail.net/en/guides/send-email-with-custom-domain-smtp">outbound SMTP emails</a>, which allowed me to simplify how I configure and send emails for my projects. I used Mailgun and Sendgrid, but my send volume was just low enough that I struggled to keep Sendgrid from closing my account.¬†</p>
<p>Forward Email also now supports <a href="https://forwardemail.net/en/free-email-webhooks">Email webhooks</a>, and they have an Email API, which could be handy for a few projects.¬†</p>
<p>If you work on any number of side projects and you find yourself dreading email, as I did, I recommend Forward Email to at least route email to one email account while having the right dials and switches to make the experience not suck.</p>

			 <p>A few times a week over the last several months, I have paired with ChatGPT to work on Python scripts that solve problems that I would otherwise have spent less time on. Some might feel too niche or even too tedious that I would otherwise not take the time to work on. Most of the time, these are scratching an itch and solving a problem on my mind.</p>
<p>Because of the time constraint, I have been impressed with the results. I usually spend 10 to 15 minutes prompting ChatGPT, then I spend 10 to 15 minutes refactoring the script, adding <a href="https://typer.tiangolo.com">Typer</a>, and refining the code. Sometimes, this involved copying all or parts of my script and pasting it back into ChatGPT to have it refine or refactor some section of code.</p>
<h2 id="youtube-playlist-to-markdown-file">YouTube Playlist to Markdown file</h2>
<p>My <a href="https://gist.github.com/jefftriplett/4bf333453d7cab320aa45767b1949be6">YouTube playlist to markdown script</a> is helpful for quickly getting a list of video URLs and titles back from a YouTube playlist. I have used this for DjangoCon US and a few other conferences to help collect links for social media and a few times for the <a href="https://django-news.com">Django News Newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>ChatGPT even documented the process, including links for how to set permissions for the YouTube API.</p>
<h2 id="use-playwright-to-pull-data-out-of-the-django-admin">Use Playwright to pull data out of the Django Admin</h2>
<p>I have database access for most projects, but I recently needed to export a list of RSS feeds from the admin of a Django website. ChatGPT could quickly write a Playwright script to log in to the website, access a list page, and pull the feed field from the detail page. The script generated a JSON feed and could understand pagination and how to page through the links.</p>
<h2 id="github-issues-and-pull-request-templates">GitHub Issues and Pull Request templates</h2>
<p>For the <a href="https://github.com/wsvincent/awesome-django">Awesome Django project</a>, I asked ChatGPT to generate GitHub Issues and Pull Request templates based on my criteria. Once the templates were complete, I prompted ChatGPT to help me write a script that uses the GitHub API to read a pull request and validate the answers filled out while adding some other contextual data that makes it easier to verify the request.</p>
<h2 id="modeling-html-with-pydantic">Modeling HTML with PyDantic</h2>
<p>I am still trying to figure out what to do with the project, but I asked ChatGPT to use <a href="https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic">Pydantic</a> to create a class that could represent HTML tags. Once I was happy with the API, I asked ChatGPT to represent all HTML tags. After a few more prompts, I could read, write, and represent an HTML document using this script using Pydantic.</p>
<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m still determining how useful these scripts are, but I have enjoyed these quick sessions to write a one-off script or to solve problems that come up a few times a year that never seemed worth the time spent trying to write it from scratch.</p>

			 <p>One of my favorite hosting setups is getting a cheap slice from Digital Ocean or your favorite provider, installing <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a> and <a href="https://tailscale.com">Tailscale</a>, and then fire-walling everything off except for port 443.</p>
<p>Whenever I want to host a new project, I copy a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file to the server, and then I start it with `docker compose up -d'.</p>
<p>I run <a href="https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower">Watchtower</a> in Docker on the server, which looks for new Docker images from GitHub Packages, pulls them, and restarts any updated containers.</p>
<p>I can update my projects, <code>git push</code> changes, and GitHub Actions will build and store a new container image for me.</p>
<p>My main pain point was juggling environment variables until someone pointed out <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/chamber">Chamber</a>, which manages environment variables well.</p>
<p>Since creating this setup, I have shared several GitHub Gists with curious friends, and my goal of this post is to serve as more of an overview of options than it is to be a comprehensive guide to using Chamber.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need an AWS account, some essential Docker and Compose knowledge, and to follow <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/chamber#installing">Chamber&rsquo;s Installing</a> instructions.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-my-environment">Setting up my environment</h2>
<p>Ironically, my goal of eliminating individual environment variables led me to need four environment variables to bootstrap Chamber itself.
The environment variables I&rsquo;m using:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code></li>
<li><code>AWS_REGION</code></li>
<li><code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code></li>
<li><code>CHAMBER_KMS_KEY_ALIAS=aws/ssm</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dockerfile-setup">Dockerfile Setup</h2>
<p>To make running Chamber running more straightforward, I used the <code>segment/chamber</code> Docker image, copied the <code>/bin/chamber</code> binary into my image, and configured it to run it as a <code>ENTRYPOINT</code>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a project that worked for a decade+ with only a bug or two over the years. I retired the project I built <code>django-rq-email-backend</code> for, and it&rsquo;s gathered dust ever since. I also stopped using Django RQ.</p>
<p><a href="%5Bhttps://github.com/knyghty%5D(https://github.com/knyghty)">Tom Carrick</a> reached out to me and asked me if I needed help or was open to giving it a new home. I was thankful to find someone who wanted to continue the project, so I transferred the repo and the <a href="%5Bhttps://pypi.org/project/django-rq-email-backend/%5D(https://pypi.org/project/django-rq-email-backend/)">PyPI</a> publishing rights to Tom.</p>
<p>Skip forward a few months; Tom has been running with the project and cutting new releases ever since. I felt comfortable transferring the project because I knew Tom from a few of his projects, and the project only appealed to a very niche audience.</p>
<p>Thank you, Tom, for continuing the project.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m pretty happy with this pattern and Django Ninja. My only nitpick is that I wish that Django Ninja shipped with some class-based view batteries. I find them to be much easier to extend and work from than function-based views, but I&rsquo;m told some third-party apps are starting to help fill in this space.</p>

			 <p>I have wanted to document my development setup for a while to revisit it from time to time to see how my setup changes.</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m typing this from my couch on a MacBook Pro Intel/2019 model in Lawrence, KS.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using a Mac Studio (M2/2023 model) at my office.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using a Mac Mini Pro (M2/2023 model) in my home office.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using an Intel Skull NUC (2017) and several Raspberry Pis (3s and 4s) wired to my router.</p>
<p>After a few decades of working on a laptop, I recently switched to a desktop machine because I wanted to sit down at either machine and work without carrying anything around. With two kids, I&rsquo;m also juggling backpacks, water bottles, and whatever they need at school or preschool that day. Not having to worry about carrying anything is a huge mental weight off my shoulders.</p>
<p>At home, I run three Dell S2722QC 27-inch 4K USB-C monitors and a 16&quot; portable monitor that I use as a dedicated iTerm display. At work, I use a pair of Monoprice 30&quot; monitors and another 16&quot; portable monitor for iTerm. At some point, I want to pick up the same Dell monitors for work.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>Since 2007, I have preferred developing on macOS. I&rsquo;m running on macOS Ventura on everything, but I plan to migrate to macOS¬†Sonoma sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://tailscale.com">Tailscale</a>, so I can connect to any of my machines from anywhere. I can even connect from my iPhone or an iPad. If you have more than one machine, even if that machine is a Raspberry Pi, Tailscale is worth the ~5-minute install.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a>, with some custom plugins, as my go-to &ldquo;do everything on macOS&rdquo; tool of choice.</p>
<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
<p><a href="https://draculatheme.com/">Dracula</a> is my favorite theme because it looks nice, and the community has built a theme for everything.</p>
<h2 id="home">Home</h2>
<p>I run <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io">Home Assistant</a> at home and have a love/meh relationship with it. I have a liberal usage of <a href="https://www.wyze.com">Wyze cameras and gear</a>, doubling as kid/baby monitors and external perimeter coverage around our gates and cars.</p>
<h2 id="backups">Backups</h2>
<p>Backups should be handled in layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick local backups: Every Mac runs TimeMachine and backups to an encrypted, external drive. I built my NVMe backup drive solution that I will write about sometime.</li>
<li>External, off-sight backups: I store external copies of my data on <a href="https://www.backblaze.com">BackBlaze</a>.</li>
<li>I keep a few big, noisy 8TB external backup drives for occasional snapshots.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="file-syncing">File Syncing</h2>
<ul>
<li>My documents are backed up to iCloud.</li>
<li>I use <a href="https://syncthing.net">Syncthing</a> to sync my Macs and NUC. I use this to sync projects across machines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">SublimeText</a> is my go-to text/code editor. Search is blazingly fast, runs amazingly well on both old and new hardware, and is a stable product.</p>
<p>Almost every Django project I work on runs in a container using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a> or <a href="https://orbstack.dev">Orbstack</a>. Orbstack is nice and fast, but I have many legacy projects in Docker, and the migration only worked so well.</p>
<p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all">&ldquo;scripts to rule them all&rdquo;</a> pattern because I work on tons of projects, and I never want to think twice about how to start, stop, update, open a console/shell, etc, and it does the job nicely. I will write about this later.</p>
<p>I prefer to script project workflows using <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">Just</a> because it&rsquo;s a one-file install that doesn&rsquo;t require a large development stack. It runs well both inside and outside of a container.</p>
<p>I wrote another post about <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/02/10/python-development-on.html">Python Development on macOS Notes: pyenv and pyenv-virtualenvwrapper</a> setup.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://direnv.net">direnv</a> to manage my environment variables.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m pretty happy with everything. I would like the same Dell monitor setup for the office and a TS4 dock, but everything works.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Please note: Just so you know, Grammarly told me my writing is fine. So please blame Grammarly and not me for the typos.</p>
<p>Last summer, I started hosting Office Hours on Friday afternoons. The basic idea around hosting office hours was an excuse to work on various projects and invite people to join to work on whatever projects they wanted to end their week.</p>
<p>Friday afternoons work well for me because I will have finished every task I wanted for the week, or anything left over will take me longer than an afternoon to complete, so I might as well start those on Monday instead.</p>
<p>My first session had 3 to 6 people, and then each week started slowly growing, and our last session had ~15 people. While half of the people who join each week I have known and met outside of a computer, more than half of the people who have joined office hours I have never met in person before. We have had people from all over the world, including Africa, the UK, the Netherlands, India, and Alaska, join in to chat while working on projects.</p>
<p>My humble goals for this time have always been to keep things light and serve as a welcoming space where people can join to discuss Python and Django, work on whatever project they want, and ask questions.</p>
<p>My goal wasn&rsquo;t to build a community, even if it feels like one from seeing familiar faces week after week. So there is no Discord channel, mailing list, or iCal invite.</p>
<p>Instead, I have a private GitHub gist with the invite details, the starting date + time, and a Zoom link. I DM people who ask or people find the link from having accessed it before. I have not optimized my process for growth, but it works.</p>
<p>On weeks when my son has basketball practice, I have the freedom of moving the time around earlier or later, and to my surprise, a friendly group of people always join and trickle in over the time that I have to keep the Zoom meeting up.</p>
<p>On weeks when I&rsquo;m out of town or need that Friday afternoon to hit a deadline, I update the gist to let people know that we&rsquo;ll meet again in a few weeks. The success of office hours is not forcing them and letting people know that we have them most weeks but not every week when something is up.</p>
<p>I intentionally created a space where I don&rsquo;t have the pressure to feel &ldquo;on,&rdquo; which is why it works for me, and I hope people will attend, too. There is no agenda, and I do my best to ensure everyone can talk and feel included while hanging out.</p>
<p>My stretch goal for 2024 might be to add a page on my website with the date of our next open hours that I can share with anyone curious. Maybe I&rsquo;ll even use a nice font for the page, but for now, I think the gist works as well as anything.</p>

			 <p>Note: I deleted &gt;1000 words and decided to post a summary instead.</p>
<p>Jacob Kaplan Moss slacked me his <a href="https://jacobian.org/2024/feb/16/paying-maintainers-is-good/">article</a> today because he knew I&rsquo;d like it, and we have both had ongoing conversations for years about open-source Funding. 
It&rsquo;s worth reading.</p>
<p>I mistakenly submitted the article to the orange website because I assumed someone else already had it.
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39402101">Oops.</a></p>
<p>I support funding open-source projects.
We are trillions of dollars away from providing enough Funding for open-source software before I have the patience to set through any debates about the right or wrong way to fund them. 
Let&rsquo;s make a few decades of overfunding mistakes first and then write about how to fix them after there&rsquo;s enough money flowing to make up for three decades of nothing.</p>
<p>No one owns the term open source despite the good intentions of organizations that were formed to market open source to businesses. 
While the foundations focused their energies on infighting, shaming companies founded on open source projects, fundraising to big tech companies, and refusing to address developer&rsquo;s real needs, developers kept writing and releasing open source projects, and we all moved on.</p>
<p>I started releasing and licensing projects as GPL in the 90s, MIT in the 00s, BSD in the 10s, and now I lean more towards PolyForm and the licenses that push back against Cloud companies. 
As an open-source developer, I have rights and never asked for anything outside of attribution. 
The organizations that claim to understand what open source is lost their way and lost their right to assert that they know and understand what open source software is and means.</p>
<p>To wrap this up, because it was a long week, we need less shaming and more funding for open source projects and their maintainers.</p>

			 <p>For the last few months, I have used the Django + Adam Johnson + Carlton Gibson + Oliver Andrich stack, or what I&rsquo;m calling the DACO stack. Maybe the DjACO stack rolls off the tongue more easily.</p>

			 <p>Content warning: Kansas City mass shooting.</p>
<p>Today, I worked on a post to keep up my February streak going, and then my phone started buzzing from local friends because there was a mass shooting at a pep rally in Kansas City meant to celebrate our recent Super Bowl victory.</p>
<p>I live in Lawrence, Kansas, just outside of Kansas City. I have friends who commute to Kansas City for jobs and dozens of friends who were at the parade today. Thankfully, none of them that I am aware of were hurt today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NAME REMOVED said her hospital enacted its mass casualty alert</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And children&rsquo;s mercy has taken in victims also üòî</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article285484737.html">22 people were injured, and at least one person died today</a> in my home state.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article285498797.html#storylink=cpy">Mass shooting injures 9 children, ages 6 to 15, at Chiefs Super Bowl rally on Wednesday</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article285494757.html">Johnson County mom dies in KC parade shooting.</a></p>
<p>In 2015, Missouri had the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States_by_state#2015_data">second-worst murder rate per capita</a> in the United States.</p>
<p>In 2019, Missouri had the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States_by_state#2019_data">4th worst murder rate per capita</a> in the United States despite its murder rate increasing in four years.</p>
<p>Missouri has some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state#Missouri">most unrestricted gun laws</a> in the United States.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seriously, the idea of going to any large gathering is never appealing anymore and this is the reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My six-year-old told us tonight that he hoped he never gets shot and killed like the people in Kansas City were today. He heard about it at school and didn&rsquo;t want to play outside tonight.</p>
<p>What a fucked up world we have created for kids today and ourselves.</p>

		<a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/02/11/lets-talk-about-paying-for/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-02-11 17:09:46 -0500">Feb 11, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> I wrote this quickly, proofed it via Grammarly, applied a few suggestions from ChatGPT, and revised it several times. The words and typos are still mine.</p>
<p>Discussing funding within open-source communities is often a minefield of strong opinions, self-proclaimed expertise, and a need for practical, real-world experience. This landscape is fraught with contention and quick escalations, where the mere mention of project monetization can lead to widespread panic and criticism.</p>
<p>Jacob Kaplan Moss <a href="https://social.jacobian.org/@jacob/111914179201102152">hit the nail on the head with a post</a> that pretty much sums up the dilemma:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Open source should keep going strong, and the folks behind it deserve a paycheck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But then when a maintainer tries adding paid features:<br>
&ldquo;Hold up, not like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or when they join a big tech company:<br>
&ldquo;Eh, still not like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or even when they accept some investment money:<br>
&ldquo;Nope, not like that either.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone wants developers to get paid, but we are highly critical no matter their path.</p>
<h2 id="why-im-all-for-paying-developers">Why I&rsquo;m All for Paying Developers</h2>
<p>Let me be clear: I&rsquo;m totally on board with developers getting paid for their hard work. Why? Because making open-source software is a lot like any other job‚Äîit takes time, skill, and a lot of effort. And just like any other job, it should come with some financial reward.</p>
<p>Some folks worry that bringing money into the equation could change the spirit of open-source work. But here&rsquo;s the thing: anyone can pick up open-source projects. If a project starts going in a direction that doesn&rsquo;t sit right with the community, it can be forked. That&rsquo;s the beauty of open-source. Someone else can take the project and run with it in a new direction, ensuring that the project lives on.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-thing-about-forks">The Great Thing About Forks</h2>
<p>This ability to fork a project is like a safety net. If a project starts to lose its way after being funded or commercialized, the community can fork the original code, make their version, and chart a new course.</p>
<h2 id="finding-a-middle-ground">Finding a Middle Ground</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not shy away from the money talk. Paying developers isn&rsquo;t just good for them and the entire open-source community. By finding ways to make open-source work financially sustainable, we&rsquo;re ensuring it stays strong, vibrant, and, most importantly, around for the long haul.</p>
<p>The key is to keep talking about it, to be open to new ideas, and to remember that we all want the same thing: to keep open-source software accessible and sustainable.</p>

<p>My v2 innovation was adding the <a href="https://clipboardjs.com/">clipboard.js</a> JavaScript library to press a button to copy the formatted text to my clipboard instead of selecting all of the text so that I could then copy all of the text inside the text box.</p>
<p>I recently added the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfour/elastic-textarea">elastic-textarea</a> web component, which resized the text box to grow or shrink around my formatted messages.</p>

<p>For DjangoCon US, we built several copy-to-clipboard pages, which build messages to announce talks on <a href="https://2023.djangocon.us/speaking/twitter/">social media</a> and later help build the metadata we use in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2NFhrDSOxgX41jqYSi0HmO9Wsf6WDSmf">YouTube videos</a>.</p>

			 <p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety%E2%80%93ninety_rule">ninety-ninety rule</a>, the final 10 percent of code needed to automate a task completely can take up 90 percent of the development time. This disproportionate effort is why I recommend that everyone consider semi-automating tasks and skipping the last 10%.</p>
<h2 id="quick-wins">Quick wins</h2>
<p>My goal with semi-automating tasks is to reduce the scope of a project to make automating the task easier and quicker.
The more mundane and repetitive the task, the more likely I will prioritize automating it.</p>
<p>My favorite tasks to automate fall are quick wins or redundant processes.
We use Toggl at work to log our billable hours and time spent on various projects.
We have daily stand-ups in Slack, so everyone can keep up with everyone and be on the same page about vacations or might need another set of eyes on a project.</p>
<p>Using the Toggl API, I wrote a Python script that exports my notes so I can copy and paste them into Slack.
I wrote a Python stand-up script that I run daily to see my notes from the previous day or week.</p>
<p>I could have over-engineered my script to attempt to post to Slack for me, but it turns out that all I needed was a better way to copy and paste from Toggl into Slack.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-semi-automate-tasks">Why do I semi-automate tasks?</h2>
<p><strong>Semi-automation is easier.</strong> The benefit of semi-automating tasks is to reduce the scope to be a quick, productive win.</p>
<p><strong>Semi-automation saves time.</strong> I often spend 30 minutes writing a Python script, saving me 15 minutes or more daily.</p>
<p><strong>Semi-automation saves wasted effort.</strong> For my daily stand-up project, I can use an existing Python library to access the Toggl API and display all my entries for a day or range of dates.
Most of the time, I will copy these notes as they are and paste them into Slack, or I will summarize them.</p>
<p><strong>Semi-automation takes less maintenance.</strong> Since my Python script is wrapping an existing API, there is little to no maintenance.
If the author decides they don&rsquo;t want to maintain a Toggl library anymore, switching to another library is less effort and much less complex than if I were trying to maintain my library.</p>
<p><strong>Semi-automation is often good enough.</strong> I thought about writing a Slackbot to post updates for me, but I quickly learned that it would be a bigger hassle and ultimately not worth the effort.
My most significant pain point was having to pull up Toggl to get information out of it, and with my stand-up script, I could focus on writing better summaries while logging my hours instead.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-projects-i-like-to-semi-automate">Types of projects I like to semi-automate</h2>
<p>The projects I like to semi-automate are repetitive tasks I have to do daily, weekly, and frequent enough to warrant
The more repetitive a task is, the more likely I will write a Python script or <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">casey/just</a> justfile recipe to automate it.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;copy to clipboard&rdquo; page</li>
<li>my daily stand-ups and monthly reports, which I pull from Toggl</li>
<li>use RSS feeds to help automate the collection of articles to review for a weekly newsletter</li>
<li>use justfile recipes for every project and even system-level macOS updates, so I don&rsquo;t have to remember how to update or run my projects</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="migrating-unfinished-projects">Migrating unfinished projects</h2>
<p>Once I realized that some of my unfinished projects were too ambitious, I started revisiting them to reduce the scope to something I could semi-automate to complete them.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today, I asked on Mastodon if anyone knew of a good solution for generating a Markdown table from a Django queryset. Typically, people want to convert markdown into HTML, but this was a case where I needed to export data from Django to a static website.</p>
<p>Not missing a beat, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@glasnt@cloudisland.nz/111886900012564229">Katie McLaughlin</a> recommended the <a href="https://github.com/astanin/python-tabulate">python-tabulate</a> library, which is what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Since I was short on time tonight, I asked ChatGPT to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a queryset to markdown function using the Python tabulate library.</li>
<li>Add Python types support (because it&rsquo;s 2024)</li>
<li>Rewrite the docstring</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the code looked right, I loaded up my local copy of <a href="https://jobs.django-news.com">Django News Jobs</a>, and I created a quick Django management command.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/GaretJax/django-click">django-click</a> is my go-to library for quickly writing CLI apps or what Django calls a management command. django-click reduces the boilerplate needed to write a management command down to one import, one decorator, and one function, and you get the best of the Python <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/">click</a> library with everything Django has to offer.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m happy with this approach. Django is an excellent framework for quickly prototyping and solving these problems.</p>
<p>I decided to write a management command instead of a view because markdown tables are very readable from the command line. I plan to convert it to a Django view to automate embedding tables like this into other projects.</p>

			 <p>Here are some notes on how I like to write tests for a Django app that tests a model down to a view.</p>
<h2 id="django-model--pytest-fixture">Django Model + pytest Fixture</h2>
<p>This part is a mouthful, but I prefer to use the <a href="https://github.com/model-bakers/model_bakery">Model Bakery</a> library to automatically create instances of Django models (aka a fixture) with good test data instead of manually creating them. This approach saves time and adds some variety to my test data.</p>
<p>We will also use the pytest fixture function to create and return an instance of a Django model using our Model Bakery fixture. This pytest fixture can be used in multiple test cases, ensuring consistency and reducing boilerplate code.</p>
<p>Every app in my project contains a <code>fixtures.py</code> file. My news app has a <code>Category</code> and a <code>Post</code> model, and my fixture looks like this.</p>

			 <p>Everyone has unique ways of unwinding and finding comfort after a long day. My comfort media spans a wide range, from the passive consumption of TV shows to more engaging activities like gaming and listening to podcasts. Here&rsquo;s a glimpse into my go-to sources for comfort and relaxation.</p>
<h2 id="screen-time-netflix-and-more">Screen Time: Netflix and More</h2>
<p>My comfort viewing typically involves having a series playing in the background from Netflix or another streaming platform. It&rsquo;s a form of passive binge-watching where my eyes might not always be on the screen, but my ears are tuned in, ready to engage fully when something catches my interest. Unlike music I can listen to on repeat, I rarely rewatch anything, seeking instead the familiar background noise of new episodes.</p>
<h2 id="music-and-podcasts">Music and Podcasts</h2>
<p>Music has always been a constant companion for me. From the days in college when I discovered, I could write a paper while listening to <em>August and Everything After</em> by Counting Crows to now, having playlists and new artists filling a similar role. My music consumption is repetitive, often sticking to the same album or playlist for weeks.</p>
<p>Podcasts also significantly influence my daily routine, offering various content from daily updates to weekly deep dives into fascinating subjects. They provide a mix of entertainment and information that fits perfectly into my schedule.</p>
<h2 id="books-and-audiobooks">Books and Audiobooks</h2>
<p>Despite wishing I had spent more time reading books, my day is often consumed by reading code, documentation, and messages for work. By the evening, I find my brain craves less intense engagement, making it hard to commit to reading. However, audiobooks have found their place in my routine, especially during tasks like mowing the lawn or doing yard work, where they can offer a narrative escape.</p>
<h2 id="gaming">Gaming</h2>
<p>Gaming, particularly on my Switch, offers a unique escapism that lets me shut off my brain from the day&rsquo;s worries. Over the holidays, diving into games like <em>Dave the Diver</em> provides a personal retreat and bonding activity with my son, exploring and completing tasks together.</p>
<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>
<p>Sports, especially basketball and football, serve as another layer of comfort media for me. There&rsquo;s something incredibly soothing about taking a Sunday nap with a football game playing in the background, providing a familiar, comforting backdrop to rest.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.macbartender.com">Bartender</a> and <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> are two of my favorite Mac apps. Both address shortcomings in macOS.</p>
<p>The overall quality of most Mac apps is what won me over. My <a href="https://jefftriplett.com/2023/default-apps-2023/">Default Apps 2023</a> article contains many of my favorite apps.</p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s Magic Keyboards are great. The iPad is a close second because it doubles as an external display.</p>

<p>Hand down my 2005 Mac Mini G4 shipped with Bluetooth support, which meant a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse would be with them. Not so much. I even paid way too much money for Apple&rsquo;s keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>My keyboards were PS2 then, so I had to travel to Best Buy to pick one up. Even once I had them working, the Bluetooth input lag was so slow and unresponsive that neither input device was stable. I still hate Apple mice to this day.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wholly blame the Mac Mini&rsquo;s Bluetooth support because that Mac Mini was so underpowered and had such a slow hard drive that it was barely usable. I wanted to use TextMate on it and have a decent development machine, but that was a challenge.</p>

			 <p>When deciding when to adopt a new <em>major</em> or <em>minor</em> Python or Django version, I prefer to wait until the 3rd or 4th patch release because reliability significantly improves.</p>
<p>Python and Django <code>{major}.{minor}.{patch&gt;2}</code> releases are always more stable than <code>{patch&lt;3}</code> releases.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-version-numbers">Understanding Version Numbers</h3>
<p>Version numbers typically follow a <code>{major}.{minor}.{patch}</code> format. For instance, in Django 5.0.2, &ldquo;5&rdquo; is the major version, &ldquo;0&rdquo; the minor, and &ldquo;2&rdquo; the patch. I&rsquo;ve found that a version reaching its <code>.2</code> or <code>.3</code> patch release (like Django 5.0.2 or 5.0.3) is generally a reliable indicator of stability.</p>
<h3 id="why-wait-for-the-3rd-or-4th-patch-release">Why Wait for the 3rd or 4th Patch Release?</h3>
<p>The early releases of any major software version can be unpredictable. Despite Python and Django&rsquo;s commendable track record for quality, the broader ecosystem of packages and tools that integrate with them often requires time to catch up. This adjustment period is critical for ensuring compatibility and stability, reducing the risk of unexpected issues in production environments.</p>
<h3 id="my-experience">My Experience</h3>
<p>Through trial and error, I&rsquo;ve observed that holding off until at least the 2nd patch release mitigates around 90% of potential issues. However, waiting for the 3rd or 4th patch guarantees that most significant bugs have been fixed.</p>
<h3 id="recommendations-for-implementation">Recommendations for Implementation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay Informed</strong>: Regularly review the release notes for Python and Django. This will help you understand the scope of changes and the introduction of any new features or critical fixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use a Testing Matrix</strong>: If your project employs Continuous Integration (CI), include the latest versions of Python and Django in your testing matrix sooner rather than later. This proactive measure can help identify compatibility issues early, saving you time and reducing the risk of deploying unstable code to production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community Feedback</strong>: Pay attention to feedback from the Python and Django communities. I keep a good feel of the pulse by checking social media to see what developers are having issues with. I also like to check open and recently closed GitHub Issues and Pull Requests for packages I use to see what was broken by a new release and how to fix it.</p>
